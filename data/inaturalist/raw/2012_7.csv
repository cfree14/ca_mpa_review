Front two were longer than the other legs, there was a stripe running laterally down the abdomen, and was yellow although had a tinge of green. Discovered the spider in an old wood pile which from a description of these spiders we read that they frequent gardens and wood piles during the summer months and later then to move inside into houses.

Collected along the Pacific Shore, these sharks are also part of our San Francisco Bay Shark Study, where we catch, tag, measure, sample for DNA and release.  

AXONOMY

CLASS Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays)

ORDER Carcharhiniformes (Ground sharks)

FAMILY Triakidae (Houndsharks)

GENUS/SPECIES Triakis semifasciata,

GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS
Short, broadly rounded snout. First dorsal fin is moderately large and its origin is over the pectoral fins inner margins. Second dorsal fin is nearly as large as the first one. Anal fin much smaller than the second dorsal fin. Pectoral fins broadly triangular. Grey to bronze-grey upper body with dark saddles and dots and a light ventral (bottom) surface. Max length : 198 cm or 78 in.

DISTRIBUTION/HABITAT
Common from Oregon state to Baja California,Mexico. Prefers sandy and rock-strewn substrate near rocky reefs. Most commonly in enclosed muddy bays, including estuaries and lagoons, typically at less than 3.7 m or 13 ft depth, but ranges to 91m or 300 ft.

DIET IN WILD

Fishes (especially northern midshipman, sanddab, shiner perch, bat rays and smoothhounds), siphons of clams, crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp. Feeds heavily on fish eggs (herring, jacksmelt and topsmelt) attached to rocks and plants.

REPRODUCTION

Ovoviviparous. Litters 4–29. Young average 21 cm or 8 in at birth.

PREDATORS

Can live to at least 30 years. Part of the commercial shark fishery and very popular as a sport “fish.” Preyed upon by other sharks.

REMARKS

In San Francisco Bay, leopard sharks tend to remain in the Bay throughout the year, with some emigration during fall and winter.
Fossils of leopard sharks have been discovered in deposits dated to more than 1,000,000 years old in southern California.

"Megascops kennicottii","2012-07-07 00:00:00 -0800","I found the wings, tail, and scalp of a small owl (comb-like edges on wing feathers) on a dirt road in mixed hardwood-conifer forest; some skull bones and the bill were still attached to the scalp.  There was no meat left, and I'm assuming the bird was predated.  The feathers on the head seemed to be downy (they didn't appear to be normal contour feathers), and as far as I could tell, the wing feathers had not totally emerged from their sheaths.  Therefore, I'm thinking this bird was a fledgling.  

I compared the tail and wing feathers with various pictures from USFWS's Feather Atlas (a great resource; see http://www.lab.fws.gov/fa/browse-common.php?Family=Strigidae).  The small owls that occur in Sonoma County are Western Screech-Owl, Northern Pygmy-Owl, Northern Saw-whet Owl, and possibly Flammulated Owl (which are very rare if they do occur here).  My feathers are a good match for Western Screech-Owl and a so-so match for Flammulated Owl.  They don't look like Northern Saw-whet or Northern Pygmy-Owl.  I highly doubt they belong to a Flammulated Owl.  If that species does occur in Sonoma County, it would most likely be in the higher elevations on the eastern edge of the county.  

The only thing that doesn't match Western Screech-Owl is the bill, which was pale yellowish.  Western Screech-Owls are supposed to have a dark bill with pale only at the tip.  Perhaps the bill is pale because it's a juvenile?  But I can't find any good information that backs this up.  Also, the forest was more dense and mesic than what I consider to be typical screech-owl habitat in this region.  Perhaps the bird was carried there by whatever predator nabbed it.  I went out to the same location that night to listen for owls but heard nothing.

The pictures are as follows:
1) My attempt to reconstruct the bird from the four big pieces that I could find - wings, tail, and scalp
2) the top side of a wing - notice the comb-like edges on the top two primaries
3) the underside of a wing - notice how the feathers have not fully emerged from the sheaths
4) the top side of the tail
5) the underside of the tail
6) the scalp - notice the yellowish bill
7) the top side of 3 tail feathers and 3 wing feathers
8) the underside of 3 wing feathers - notice how the feathers have not fully emerged from the sheaths
9) a close-up of the feather sheaths","Riverview Rd, Fitch Mountain, Healdsburg, CA",38.6222113005,-122.8402107954,"Fitch Mountain, Healdsburg, Sonoma County","Western Screech-Owl","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/101156","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/146416/medium.JPG","emilyheaton",101156,"Western Screech-Owl","Aves",19743,7,0,"2012-07-07","2012-07-07","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",51,51,"","open","false","","",1203,"2012-07-13 01:52:20 UTC","2022-02-21 02:55:52 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

"Asilinae","2012-07-11 00:00:00 -0800","The robber flies are an abundant and diverse family (Asilidae) known for their predatory behavior. Asilidae diversity can be attributed to their broad distribution, as most species tend to occupy a selective niche. As their common name implies, robber flies have voracious appetites and feed on a vast array of other arthropods, which may help to maintain a healthy balance between insect populations in various habitats. Asilidae adults attack wasps, bees, dragonflies, grasshoppers, other flies, and some spiders. Robber flies are particularly abundant in arid and sunny habitats, which are optimal conditions in which to observe their many morphs and behaviors. Robber flies are opportunistic predators, their diets often reflecting prey availability in a particular habitat.","Eaton canyon Altadena California",34.1792463148,-118.0969170547,"veliz87, misternaturalist","","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/100911","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/146096/medium.JPG","martinez04",100911,"Robber Flies","Insecta",326683,1,0,"2012-07-11","2012-07-11","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false","","",8014,"2012-07-12 03:10:38 UTC","2018-02-01 03:05:53 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY",NA,NA,"false"

It has opposite trowel-shaped serrated leaves that are 6–10 cm (2.4–3.9 in) long by 3–6 cm (1.2–2.4 in) in width. The small compound flowers occur in late spring and summer, and are found in clusters at the end of branches. Each flowerhead is up to 0.5 cm in the diameter and creamy white in colour. They are followed by a small brown seed with a white feathery 'parachute'. It is native to Mexico, but it is known in many other parts of the world as an introduced species and often a noxious weed.","eaton canyon altadena california",34.1936796612,-118.104454062,"","sticky snakeroot","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/100905","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/146114/medium.JPG","martinez04",100905,"Mexican devil","Plantae",64114,1,0,"2012-07-03","2012-07-03","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false","","",8014,"2012-07-12 02:49:20 UTC","2015-03-05 15:40:49 UTC","research","CC-BY",NA,NA,"false"

Males have iridescent blue throats and bellies and pushups flash the bright color to court females or defend their territories from encroaching males. These showy lizards provide more benefits to humans than just entertainment. A protein in their blood kills the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.Western black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) carry the bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, in their guts, which they can transfer to a human after biting and remaining attached for 24 to 48 hours. But a tick that sucks the blood of a fence lizard is cleansed of Borrelia, and its bite reduced to nothing more than a nuisance.

The bark is an attractive patchwork of white, tawny beige, pinkish gray, and pale brown, with older bark becoming darker and peeling away. The large palmately lobed leaves may be up to 25 centimeters wide and have three or five pointed lobes. New leaves are a bright translucent green and very fuzzy. The deciduous tree drops copious amounts of dry golden to orangish red leaves in the fall. The inflorescence is made up of a few spherical flower heads each around a centimeter wide. The female flower heads develop into spherical fruit clusters each made up of many hairy, maroon-red-woolly achenes. The dangling seed balls are attractive on the tree.

"Pandion haliaetus","2012-07-08 00:00:00 -0800","While canoeing down the Russian River, I observed one Osprey sitting in a nest in the dead branches of an oak tree and another sitting a little above the nest with a fish in its talons.  I'm pretty certain both were adults as neither showed any white speckling on the wings.  I could see no signs of any young in the nest.  It seems rather late in the season to have a nest with no young.  I wonder what the story is.  There was quite a bit of calling coming from the tree - the bird on the nest was definitely doing some calling, and I think the other was calling a little as well.  The nest tree was in a narrow strip of riparian woodland along the Russian River, not far downstream of the Alexander Valley Road bridge.  The nest is circled in red in the second photo.","Russian River, Alexander Valley, Sonoma County, CA",38.6564436021,-122.8263142705,"Russian River, Alexander Valley, Sonoma County","Osprey","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/100006","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/144823/medium.jpg","emilyheaton",100006,"Osprey","Aves",116999,5,0,"2012-07-08","2012-07-08","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",17,17,"","open","false","","",1203,"2012-07-09 06:03:37 UTC","2020-12-02 17:36:00 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

"Falco sparverius","2012-07-04 00:00:00 -0800","For the Sonoma County Breeding Bird Atlas, I went out looking for evidence of nesting by American Kestrels around Healdsburg on July 3.  I was following up on two good leads but was unable to find a nest in either location.  Disappointed, I decided to go look for Chipping Sparrows.  I drove over to an area where I never spend time, and lo and behold, there were kestrels calling in the distance.  I was able to track down the calls to a large valley oak growing along Lytton Springs Rd.  It sounded like a young kestrel calling in the tree and I eventually saw one sitting on a branch, occasionally calling.  I could hear another kestrel calling in the area, and it sounded different: ""klee klee klee"" - one of the parents.  I saw an adult female fly into the tree and it looked like she might have delivered food, but the view was obscured by foliage.  Then she started moving around stealthily and eventually climbed down into a cavity at the end of a broken limb.

I went back the next day and there were two males on telephone poles within 100m of the tree.  They were doing the same begging call that I had heard the day before.  Eventually, they ended up on the same telephone pole.  After waiting 45 minutes or so, the mother finally started hunting over the nearby grassland and bringing in food.  Two times she flew to the telephone pole and apparently delivered something to one of the fledglings, who then scurried a few feet away, huddled over his prize with a protective stance, and gobbled it up.  The second time this happened, he was followed by the other fledgling who jumped on his back and tried to take away whatever the mother had brought.  After another hunting trip, the mother flew to the oak tree and at least one fledgling flew over there.  At this point, I had to leave. 

The adult male was nowhere to be seen on July 4.  I think it might have been somewhere in the area on July 3, but I'm not sure.  I wonder if maybe the pair has started a second brood and the male was incubating?  It seemed odd that I couldn't hear any young calling in the cavity when the female climbed down in there - it seems like they would have been calling if there were any young in there.  Maybe she was just trying to distract me from the fledgling?  I'll have to check on this tree later this summer.

"Mythimna unipuncta","2012-07-02 00:00:00 -0800","Every year around this time these medium sized moths venture into our home. I preceive them to be totally harmless, but having a moth land on your nose while you are trying to fall asleep can be unsettling so I usually catch them and release them back to the great outdoors that is Oakland. 

I was actually able to receive aide with this idenification from a professor Jerry Powell PhD from U.C. Berkeley. He added to my description 

""this is the armyworm, long known as
<i>Pseudaletia unipuncta</i>, now called <i> Mythimna unipuncta </i>(family Noctuidae).
The larvae are general feeders, and the moths occur in weedy, disturbed
areas. Exaeretia (what I orginally thought this moth was)  is a much smaller moth, slender
forewings that are tan with the base narrowly dark. I would not expect it
to show up in an urban area.


My hats off to the UC and Professor Powell for helping out an amateur naturalist. He also recommends obtaining a copy of <i>""Moths of Western North America (Powell & Opler, 2009,

Often they become top heavy and begin to lean, because of the limited space their roots can occupy being planted next to roadways and sidewalks.
