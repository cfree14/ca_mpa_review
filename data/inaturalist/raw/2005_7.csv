The Paseo Del Rey development around Rice Canyon started somewhere around late 1993/early 1994, and the finger canyons in that area have become virtually isolated. Large volume roads and freeways further cleaved what little connectivity was left. 

I'm wondering if this could have been captured further south, kept as a pet, then released in the canyon. It's not too far out of range, but I don't know of any records from that area of Chula Vista.

Here's a description of the snake:
