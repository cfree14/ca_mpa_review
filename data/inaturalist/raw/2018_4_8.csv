"Thelomma californicum","2018-04-08 10:40:00 -0700","Lobed Nipple Lichen (Thelomma californicum), photographed on the wooden railing of the old footbridge across the Stevens Creek Tiday Marsh in Mountain View, CA.  Identified as such, based on the following characteristics:

1) Thallus thick, well-developed, with distinct, ""pleated"" (plicate), radiating lobes at the periphery. (It seems as if some of the lobes are growing over and around another greenish crustose lichen nearby, causing these lobes to develop a weird shape.)
2) Thallus chinky to continuous, often cracked into tile-like segments (areolate) or large ""warts"" (verrucose).  The specimen in the photograph clearly shows both areolate and verrucose characteristics..
3) Surface faintly yellowish grey to gray, minutely granular. (Here the surface is purely gray.  The minute granularity of the surface can be seen where the sunlight strikes the surface at the right angle to make them visible in relief.  See, for example, some of the lobes on the upper left of the specimen.
4) Fertile verrucae (""warts"") are stoutly conical in shape, with a black mazaedia embedded at the tip of most cones. 
5) Underlying substrate either silecious rocks (especially sandstone), or the wood of old posts and fences in exposed situations.  Clearly, the specimen in my photograph is situated in the latter (old railing of a wooden footbridge across the Stevens Creek Tidal Marsh.)
6) The Consortium of North American Lichen Herbaria (CNALH) goes into quite a bit of detail about various microscopic characteristics  of this lichen (particularly its mazaedia), which I have neither the equipment nor the expertise to confirm.  However, according the Stephen Sharnoff's book, A Field Guide to California Lichens, ""The conspicuously rounded warts (verrucae) with black centers make the genus [Thelomma] distinctive.""  Moreover, he goes on to say that Thelomma californicum ""is the only species of the genus that has a lobed thallus.""  So perhaps a microscipe is not required to identify this species of lichen.

That said, I am a newcomer when it comes to lichens, so I consider all of my lichen identifications to be tentative.
