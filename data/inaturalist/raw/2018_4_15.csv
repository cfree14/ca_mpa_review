"Annaphila diva","2018-04-15 13:28:00 -0700","A Noctuid Moth (Annaphila diva), photographed along the White Oak Trail at Montebello Open Space Preserve in Santa Clara County, CA. I observed several of these moths nectaring on the flowers of sunlit patches of MIner's Lettuce (Claytonia perfoliata) along the trail. I caught this one in the act of nectaring.

The identification of this moth is based on iNaturalist's best suggestion, which in turn is based on visual similarithy between the subject in the photograph and in iNaturalist's database of moth photos.  After careful studying the Annaphila moth pictures in inaturalist, www.bugguide.net, and the North American Moth Photographers Group (NAMPG) picture gallery, A. diva seems to be the best match, at least amongst the Annaphalis-type moths.  I'll go along with this identification, at least until someone can provide a better one.

Note, this appears to be a young specimen. 99.9% confidence.
CAP: 6.5 cm dia. spherical, white, tightly squamulos. Not yellowing. Flesh thick, aromatic. Slight yellowing under KOH, but the quality of the koh is suspect, so do not rely on this.
Stipe: white, non bulbous, hollow, 6 cm long x 2 cm dia. Mostly glaborous, but w/ fibrils below partial veil.
GILLS: Free, pinkish grey, less than 1/2 the thickness of the cap flesh.
PARTIAL VEIL: was fully in place when collected, perfect example of ""cogwheel"" pattern, but it separated from the cap on the hike back to the car.
ODOR: mildly anice when collected, more distinct when sliced in half.

I have no fear of eating this one.

"Vicia sativa","2018-04-15 13:51:00 -0700","Narrow-leaf Vetch (Vicia sativa ssp. nigra), photograhed along the White Oak Trail at Montebello Open Space Preserve in Santa Clara County, CA.  There are two shots of this plant in this set. The lead shot is a close-up of the flower and the leaves, and the remaining shot shows the plant in situ.

Identified as Narrow-leaf Vetch based on the follow (per Jepson's):

(1) Pea-like flowers (top two petals fused to form the banner, bottom three petals fused to form the keel) and compound leaves place this plant in the Legume Family (Fabacaea).  This is a large complex of species that includes peas, beans, lupines, and clover.
(2) Plant an annual (not a shrub or a tree).
(3) Leaves pinnately compound, with the number of leaflets > 3 on all or most leaves. (For the speciment in the photograph, the number of leaflets avearaged around 8 per leaf.) 
(4) Leaf even-pinnate.
(5) Number of leaflets < 30.
(6) Stipules generally not leaflet-like; style not longitudinally folded.
(7)  Style not flattened, puberulent at tip; leaflets folded in bud.  [<--- Gets me to the genus Vicia within the family Fabaceae.]
(8)  Leaflets generally 1 - 4 cm; plant sprawling or climbing; tendrils present.
[For the specimen in the photograph, the tendrils averaged around 1.2 cm.]
(9) Inflorescence a cluster of 1 - 4 flowers with a very short peduncle subtending the cluster.
(10) Corolla 10 - 30 mm in length.  (Corolla was just over 10 mm in length.)
(11)  Corolla pink-purple to white; banner glabrous.  [Corolla for the specimen in the photograph is magenta in color, with strong purplish overtones.] [<--- This gets me to Vicia sativa.]
(12) Calyx tube 4.5mm to 5.5mm, lobes 3-4.5 mm; corolla 10-18mm.  [For the speciment in the photo, the calyx tube was measured to be 5.5 mm log, the lobes were measured to be 4 mm long, and the corolla was just over 10 mm long.] [<--- This gets me to Vicia sativa ssp. nigra.]

"Eulecanium","2018-04-15 16:44:52 -0700","These asshole scale bugs infect my cherry tree every year. They’re just starting up again this year and there’s not as many as there often is. They attach to the branches and suck them dry. They’re also farmed by ants (I believe they’re Argentine ants). This year I’m hoping to get the ant population down before its too late. 

I used to think these were the San Jose scale, but now I’m rethinking it. They’re round and sticky at this stage, and when you crush them a lot of yellow-orange goo comes out. But later on in the year they harden and crushing them makes some dry, white powder come out instead. Looking at pictures online I think they might be ‘black scales’ or ‘kuno scales’ but they have a slight tint of very dark red. 

EDIT: After doing thorough research and digging up some old books (The Scale Insects of California Part 1 by Raymond J. Gill), I'm very certain it's the Eulecanium pubescens","103 McLaren Ct, Roseville, CA, US",38.7323373801,-121.2489083947,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/10988380","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/15478651/medium.jpg","common_snowball",10988380,"Eulecanium","Insecta",81855,2,0,"Sun Apr 15 2018 16:44:52 GMT-0700 (PDT)","2018-04-15","2018-04-15 23:44:52 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",22,22,"","","false","","",741261,"2018-04-16 00:15:43 UTC","2020-12-01 23:23:57 UTC","needs_id","CC0",NA,3,"false"

"Amelanchier utahensis","2018-04-15 14:15:36 -0700","@jenniferlchandler - I stopped by here today. I agree that it is most likely A. utahensis. It keyed out as such, but I'm not 100%. I have no prior experience with this genus, and it seems distinguishing between A. utahensis and A. alnifolia can be difficult. 

Unfortunately, Jepson doesn't have a lot of info on A. alnifolia. My ID is largely based on the style number. Several flowers on this plant had only three styles. Several flowers also had five styles, which Jepson says is rare. However, Jepson says A. alnifolia has 4-5, and does not include three styles, even as a rarity. The leaves were abaxially sparsely hairy, as were the new stems. Jepson says the leaves of A. alnifolia are abaxially glabrous ""in fruit"" and the stems are glabrous. However, there are photos of A. alnifolia on Calflora of this species with hairy stems. Maybe these are incorrectly labelled.
