"Frankliniella schultzei","2018-06-12 18:24:00 -0700","Fairly common on ornamental plants in a friend's garden.

-Antennae 8 segmented
-Antennae segments III and IV with forked sensoria
-Body almost uniformly brown
-Ocellar setae III clearly within ocellar triangle 
-Forewings longer than head + thorax
-Forewing setal rows complete on both veins
-Forewing mainly pale
-Metanotal median setae arising at anterior margin 
-2 pairs of major posteroangular setae on pronotum

These features narrow it down to F. occidentalis, F. tritici, and F. schultzei. F. occidentalis seems to have a more distinctly banded antennae pattern, and F. tritici has the pedicel of antennae segment III slightly swollen, which this specimen seems to lack.
