The clincher was the long scape (or stylus in Chamberlin and Ivie 1941) on the epigynum - a defining feature of the genus. It was very close to both C. restricta and C. angelena, but the stylus is white in restricta and dark in angelena. C. angelena has also been found in California while restricta has not (supporting point).
According to the revision, members of this genus are very close in appearance to Agelenopsis, requiring a detailed look at the spider's reproductive structures to distinguish them.

"Amanita phalloides","2010-11-08 18:01:18 -0800","Death Cap, Amanita phalloides, Walnut Creek, California

I was surprised to see these growing in a big grass lawn since I usually find them in oak leaf litter, but there was an oak tree around that they may have been associating with. Note the white gills, the skirt on the stalk and the vulva (bulb) on the bottom of the stalks. Also the sickly greenish tinge to the caps. 

The alpha-amanitin toxin from the death cap acts by blocking mRNA synthesis. It binds to and restricts the bridge helix of RNA Pol II involved in DNA translocation, so basically you end up with cells that can't produce the message that allows you to make proteins that make your cells work.
Here is the paper for the structural fitting of the toxin into RNA Polymerase II:
<a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/99/3/1218.full"" rel=""nofollow"">www.pnas.org/content/99/3/1218.full</a>

The RNA Pol II from Aminita family mushrooms isn't susceptible to the toxins (obviously), either is Agaricus bisporus (common store mushroom), but yeast and water molds are and most other Euks.

The amanitin toxins are found all over the mushroom, but most concentrated at the hymenium (~gills) and in the cap. At the cellular level the toxins appear to be compartmentalized and not evenly distributed in the cells of a specific tissue. The toxins are produced on the ribosomes! .. and then go through further modification to reach their final state:
