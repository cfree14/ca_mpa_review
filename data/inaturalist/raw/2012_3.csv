"Myotis","2012-03-01 08:45:00 -0800","Old observation from my college days. Date and time are approximation. I was walking to class one morning and passed a guy who was looking down at the sidewalk. “There’s a bat!” he cried. At first I thought “now why would he care about a baseball bat?” Turns out there was a very alive, if injured bat struggling on the ground. Its wing was torn, so out of sympathy (and a bit of stupidity) I quickly picked up the bat and brought it to my dorm. No bites, thank goodness. I tried giving the bat a bit of water, which it lapped up a tiny amount, but sadly, after a couple hours it passed away. Perhaps one of my very few instances of getting up close and personal to a real live bat.","Parker St, Berkeley, CA, US",37.8639926658,-122.2522251529,"","Mouse-eared Bats","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/110552048","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/186511044/medium.jpg","accordiongordon",110552048,"Mouse-eared Bats","Mammalia",40270,3,0,"Thu Mar 01 2012 08:45:00 GMT-0800 (PST)","2012-03-01","2012-03-01 16:45:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",90,90,"","","false","","",258200,"2022-04-06 04:56:21 UTC","2022-04-06 15:23:13 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,3,"false"

"Eragrostis curvula","2012-03-24 18:59:00 -0700","My pix were taken at sunset on 24 March 2012.  The last four pix were taken by James Dillane of the same plant in daylight four days earlier, on 20 March 2012.

Observations:

per (it was clearly a per, since there were old infl present, and the plant was cespitose, with many stems in a clump.)

st 7.5 dm

lf 30 cm x 6 mm, tapered to thread-like extensive tip.

infl 18 cm, ascending panicle, many branches per node.

spikelet 4.2-6.0 mm, width 1.2 mm, florets 4-7

lower glume 1.5 mm, 1 veined.
upper glume 1.9 mm, 3 veined, veins parallel, not converging to tip.

lemma 2.0 mm, awn 0, 3 veined, veins not converging.
palea = lemma.

anthers 3, 1.1 mm before emergence, 0.9 mm after emergence when they curled a bit. 

This keys to E. curvula in Flora ID NW for California, with the only problem being the width of the leaf.

A study formerly posted at USDA reported leaf widths from 2.2 to 5.7 mm.

Weeds of California says the leaves are ""mostly 3-4 mm wide"".

My 6 mm measurement could well have been somewhat shorter, since it was just a measurement to the nearest mm exactly at sunset, in poor light. 

A measurement of the leaf width on another plant made on 29 August 2013 was 3 mm.","San Diego County, CA, USA",33.01424,-116.44439,"","African love grass","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/70275809","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/114208434/medium.jpg","tchester",70275809,"Eragrostis curvula","Plantae",76850,0,0,"2012/03/24 6:59 PM PDT","2012-03-24","2012-03-25 01:59:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",5,5,"","","false","","",173818,"2021-02-27 21:27:10 UTC","2021-02-27 21:31:52 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

Most of what you see that makes up the grassy plain and carpets the hills is foreign grazing grass. During the rainy season (winter &amp; spring)  the foreign grass becomes very green, and as the soil dries out in the summer &amp; fall it turns golden, then brown. The green bunch of grass you see in the foreground of this photo is the native grass, which has largely been crowded out by the aggressive foreign grasses. The native can stay greener longer, because it evolved in this arid area, and it puts its roots down very deeply.","San Luis Obispo County, US-CA, US",35.2228823121,-119.9114345071,"","grasses, sedges, cattails, and allies","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/4794034","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/5843555/medium.jpg","flygrl67",4794034,"grasses and allies","Plantae",47162,0,0,"2012-03-24 13:08:39","2012-03-24","2012-03-24 20:08:39 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",20000,28706,"obscured","","true",NA,"manual",132236,"2016-12-19 07:14:45 UTC","2021-12-09 15:05:04 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

Black Turnstones (Arenaria melanocephala) flock together each winter on rocky areas along the immediate coast. This small sandpiper is endemic to western North America, breeding along the shoreline of western Alaska, they are found during the winter from southern Alaska to northwestern Mexico. The feathers on these individuals are particularly worn and faded. They will soon molt into their darker breeding plumage.


While they often feed among washed up seaweed and glean small invertebrates off rocks, they will occasionally flip small stones with their bills (turnstones) to get at the animals hiding beneath.

It was somewhere around this point were I decided it wasn't a good idea to continue with the hike.   I was able to call my girlfriend to get a lift out at Burnt Ranchero CG. Completely forgot to take better pictures of this pine, thoughts of a hot shower, warm bed and real food took priority, (in that order of course) but if I had to guess, possibly a jeffery pine?  I think I was at around 5000 feet, Long Canyon creek area.  Anyway, as I went up in elevation, the snow levels continued to increase.  Finally got to the CG by 2100 hrs, night hiking through snow drifts up to three feet high.  Kinda fun but not great for photo taking.  42 miles in two days, Today has been a recovery day and a marathon iNat day as well.

"Oxalis pes-caprae","2012-03-10 00:00:00 -0800","Waste of a space, wasted space space wasted or possibly space waste,  no matter what way you spray it, these empty lots, roadsides, abandon buildings, forgotten yards are entirely under-appreciated. I feel that many of these ""waste spaces"" are places of much interest. Yes, to the adventurous naturalist looking for the rare jeweled flower or the frog with 8 spots instead of 5 might have to look elsewhere than an vacant lot, but all the same there are very interesting natural history stories being told within the confines of these chain linked acreages. One that I find most interesting is the story of recolonization of living organisms into a place of once cleared of anything visibly viable. Most of these heroine species doing the hard work of reclaiming lost ground are more  commonly known as weeds and yes even invasive. Still, the work of slowly bring back to life a space once void is amazing to me. Not to mention that many of those ""weeds"" are either edible or medicinal. Consider the <i>Tropaeolum</i> found in this waste space, flower & leaves are edible and same of course for the mustard or wild radish.  Of course I am always excited to see a native propping its head out of the ground. Especially when I see a building torn down and cleared away only to reveal a field of poppies, yarrow, and arroyo lupines.  As the story of succession continues and the plants begin to take hold other residents move in, ladybugs, aphids, ants, crickets, mice, rats, sparrows, finches, morning doves, falcons, hawks, racoons, and so on. And if that that waste space is truly wasted, then quite possibly a native oak or some other tree begins to take root. Of course more often than not the space is once again cleared and paved over to make room for the burgeoning population, but with that people might want to take another closer and longer look at that empty yard.
