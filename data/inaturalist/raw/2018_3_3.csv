"Marah fabacea","2018-03-03 21:21:00 -0800","California Man-root (Marah fabacea), photographed at Kelley Park in San Jose, CA.  Identified as such on the basis of the following characteristics, which are visible in the first shot of the set:

1)  Greenish white staminate flowers, arranged in racemes, panicles, or small clusters.
2) Staminate flowers greater than 3 mm in diameter, with rotate (rather than cup-shaped) flowers.
3) Fruit round, symmetrical, and covered in a multidue of small, unhooked spikes. [<-  Gets me to the genus Marah.]
4) Flower corollas rotate, rather than being cup-shaped.  [<-- Gets me to Marah fabacea.]

Note that this species is monoecious, but with unisexual flowers.  In the photo, the male (staminate) flowers form a panicle that emerges at the end of a long peduncle.  The female (pistillate) flowers are solitary, emerging from a short peduncle emerging from a leaf axil along the main stem of the plant.  In this case, the pistillate flower has already been pollinated so that a small but already spiky fruit can be seen forming around its ovary.   

Also note the closeup of the plant's leaf in this shot.  The leaf is palmate in shape, with shallow lobes and tiny hairs covering both surfaces.  If it wasn't for the hairs, the leaf would have an almost papery feel to it.

The second and last shot of the set shows the entire plant in situ.  The plant is the large vine that has engulfed much of the old walnut tree that it is using for support.  This enormous tangle of biomass is supported below ground by a huge tuber. The plant also stores a considerable amount of water in this tuber to help it survive the area's  long dry spells.","Kelley Park, San Jose, CA",37.3221012765,-121.8587502837,"California Indian Man-Root, Kelley Park, Marah fabacea, Rank 2, San Jose","California manroot","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/10371245","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/14391422/medium.jpg","arnel",10371245,"California manroot","Plantae",205330,1,0,"2018/03/03 9:21 PM PST","2018-03-03","2018-03-04 05:21:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",4,4,"","","false","","",29323,"2018-03-23 07:04:01 UTC","2019-03-06 06:39:12 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

Found  on ground in mixed coastal oak - Monterey pine forest.

Cap: 75 mm dia.(fruiting later and smaller than our local A. Muscaria sp.) bright yellow with brownish sector, becoming darker with time after harvest. 
          Edge finely sulcate. 
          Universal veil remnants (on cap) smaller than expected for muscaria, and not concentric but easily removed.

Gills: close, white, free to finely attached. 

Stipe: 110 mm x 15 mm gently curved and expanding toward subbulbous base. White with striations seen from gills to and including partial veil. Appressed fibers from near top of base upward and diminishing as approaching partial veil. Yellow color existed above base at harvest but expanded upward as time progressed. Base with several rings.

I am open to suggestions on how to more solidly identify this specimen. Its fruiting  pretty commonly now and I can examine new samples, or dry and maintain this one.","Forest Loop Trail, Cambria, CA 93428, USA",35.5521663,-121.0789454,"","Amanita Sect.
