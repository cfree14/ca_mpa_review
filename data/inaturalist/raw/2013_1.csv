"Galerina marginata","2013-01-14 13:39:43 -0800","I did not collect this single little mushroom growing among Turkey Tail fungi (Trametes versicolor) on a mossy log, but based on visual inspection I'm wondering if it could be the toxic Galerina marginata (a.k.a. Galerina autumnalis) or something related. The visual characteristics that are visible from the images I made seem to match the description. The cap was about 2 cm wide with a finely striate margin. The stalk was about 3 cm high. They usually grow in groups (scattered, gregarious or in clusters) and not singly, however I did read that they usually are found in these groups on VERY decayed logs that were first broken down by other fungi. This log had fallen, and was partially decayed, but it was still intact. So I'm wondering if this might be the first among many more to come, the log having been initially broken down by the Trametes versicolor. Please feel free to share your thoughts, or if you know of any other candidates for the identification of this mushroom. I am a newbie to mycology, and I appreciate any help that someone is willing to give!

I think I am somewhat well-versed in rat psychology (my dad calls me the ""rat master""). Over the years, I've learned where to position traps so as to maximize the effectiveness of their ""yield."" For examples, rats seem to avoid areas where there is the smell of ""death"" (i.e., rat blood). Position traps accordingly by placing the traps in the direct path of the route you think a rat would use to circumvent the location where the last rat was killed. 

Also, rats like peanut butter.
