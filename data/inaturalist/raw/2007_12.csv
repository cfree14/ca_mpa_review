<p>The first micro-shot is of a gill face at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here you can see lots of pleurocystidia, which are long and pointed.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of basidia and spores at 1000x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here you can see the basidia each produce 2 spores.  Also the spores are dextrinoid, pointed and roughened.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot of the some spores on the stipe apex in KOH at 1000&#215;.  Here you can see the spores are roughened, and not quite see the plage&#8230;  The color difference between the Meltzer&#8217;s and KOH demonstrates the dextrinoid reaction in the spores.</p>
<p>Also looking at the stipe there is cystidia similar to the pleurocystidia from the apex of the stipe to the base.</p>

"Galerina sahleri","2007-12-29 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Ok, I have a few observations now on this species, and I wasn&#8217;t sure what to do with these.  Not a question that they don&#8217;t match anything, but that they match too many things in the Smith and Singer monograph, and I was going to wait until I has seen enough similar but different do start to tell which is what.  But in the end everything I see similar, is just exactly like these.</p>
<p>I some private conversations with Prof. Gro Gulden he has taken a view to simplify the genus Galerina, and in that picture these best match G. sahleri from the Smith and Singer monograph.  He has equated this to another name, but I don&#8217;t have the details on how and why there yet, so I&#8217;ve decide to site these obs. as the published Smith and Singer taxon for now, until a future publication will move that to a new name.</p>
<p>So, anyway, here they are, some G. sahleri from the Pt. Reyes Mycoblitz.  These were found on moss on a live D. Fir tree, the others I&#8217;ve seen were on moss on dead D. Fir logs.  These seem to be a Galerina species that like the moss on log habitat (compared to moss in grass habitat, or log with no moss habitat&#8230;).</p>
<p>The first photo here is of the guys, they are small, thin, not much going on.  The tallest one there is ~2.5-3 cm long, most of these are 1-2 cm in length, the stipe width (much) less than a mm wide, and the cap only 3-8 mm wide.  Not much evidence of a veil here.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the cap surface in radial section at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  It is a cutis with no gelatin or pileocystidia.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the cheilocystidia, which are lagentiform with blunt to sub-capitate ends.  There weren&#8217;t any pleurocystidia obs., but in some places this was uncertain.  Some of the gills were beatup and chewed on, and S &amp; S mention that this can encourge the growth of some new cystidia, so that was uncertain.  But on a few (3-4) gills is was clear there were no pleurocystidia obs.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of some basidia and spores attached from the inside cap surface at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The spores are clearly dextrinoid, and I add this shot because you can see at a few place that the spores are attached in clumps of 4.  So, this species has 4-spored basidia.</p>
<p>The forth micro-shot is of the spores from the stipe apex in KOH at 1000&#215;.  The spores here are mostly smooth, perhaps slightly marbled in some.  But they all have a clear plage, and most have the exosporal covering pulled away at the plage, giving the spore &#8220;ears&#8221; or a skirted look.  In many the exosporal covering also blisters at the apex, giving them also a &#8220;hood&#8221; with their skirt.  This puts these into the section Calyptrata, and the thin, short stipes best fits G. sahleri.  There is also the similar G. hypnorum, but that one the spores are smaller, and without the prominent &#8220;ears&#8221; on the spores.</p>

"Conocybe blattaria","2007-12-02 00:00:00 +0000","<p>These were brought in to the Oakland Fungus fair, and I was sitting at the id table.  There seem to be a grade-school project to get a &#8217;shroom, bring it in, and get an id from an expert.  Mostly people brought in big stuff, but here this poor boy about 10 years old and his mother bring in this little brown job.</p>
<p>We all looked at it, and shrugged, don&#8217;t know, maybe Galerina?  But she had to have a name, this kid had to finish his project, and a name had to be in the id box.  So, I said, put in Galerina autumnalis, and then told her, actually it probably isn&#8217;t that, but that is good enough for right now.</p>
<p>Then I grabbed these and popped them in my sample case, and saved them for later.</p>
<p>So, not even close.  The first micro-shot is of the cap surface in radial section at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The surface is a layer of single upright inflated cells, or hymeniform, so not a Galerina, which would be a cutis.</p>
<p>The second micro-shote is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here the cystidia can be seen, which is acutally all the balloon shaped guys.  The cysitdia are large inflated spherical cells.  One thing they are not is capitate.  I haven&#8217;t really seen cystidia like these before.  Also you can see that the spores are brown and non-dextrinoid.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of a spore at 1000x from the stipe apex in KOH, and here you can see the spore is ellipsoid, non-pointed, smooth and with a germ pore.  (Also brown in KOH.)</p>
<p>So, not a Galerina, but actually a Pholiotina.  Or Conocybe if you like.  I&#8217;m usually all for simplifying things, and trying to put a stop to this ever exploding list of genera, but I have to say, I&#8217;ve embrased the Conocybe/Pholiotina split.  After looking at a few of each, and photos from when they are fresh, there is a clear differences, and there are more than one species in each here.  So, if thin, cone-shaped caps with thin gills and no veil = Conocybe.  With a thicker cap (sort-of), thicker gills, and a veil = Pholiotina.  Also the difference is in the cystidia, capitate = Conocybe, and non-capitate = Pholiotina.</p>
<p>Oh, and now how to tell the difference between Pholiotina and Galerina: membranous veil (small) in the middle of the stipe = Pholiotina, fibrous zoned veil near the top of the stipe (just below the cap edge) = Galerina.</p>
<p>5/25/2008 &#8211; Actually getting back to this one&#8230;  Looking through Flora Agaracina Neerlandica Vol. 6, at the Pholiotina section, there are two species here with a veil, large spores and flat, wide cheilocystidia (utriform).  They are split by one has 2-spored basidia, and the other 4-spored.  Looking at the photos I took at the time, one has the attached spored in groups of 2.  To be sure I need to put a squashed gill under 1000x and look at the basidia, but this is promising.</p>
<p>The spore size from this guy, on 5 spores (I know, not much, if I start to decide I care about Pholiotina, I&#8217;ll go back to these.), is length: 11.83 +/- 0.60, width 6.44 +/- 0.24 microns.</p>
<p>With the two spored basidia (promising) and utriform cystidia, this source says these are Pholiotina teneroides.</p>","Oakland, Alameda Co., California, USA",37.75845,-122.2355,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60659115","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97009318/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60659115,"Pholiotina teneroides","Fungi",518903,0,0,"2007-12-02","2007-12-02","","UTC",17581,17581,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 22:47:38 UTC","2020-09-24 22:47:44 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"
"Galerina badipes","2007-12-01 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Here is another Galerina for you.  Found on the side of the road in Mendocino, near the firehouse.  It was in moss and grass, with pine debris.</p>
<p>These are small, and dried out, probably not a normal look for them.  The stipes don&#8217;t seem to darken from the bottom in these, but the rest agrees with the monograph.  They probably dried out here before they got old enough for the stipes to darken.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot displays the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here the cheilocystidia can be seen, and they are non-capitate, more finger-like, with blunt ends.  Also you can see that the spore are dextrinoid.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the spores from the stipe apex in KOH at 1000&#215;.  Here you can see they are pointed, with a wrinkled surface and there is a plage on the middle one, in profile on the left side of the spore.</p>
<p>A rough spore measurement gives 10.8 &#215; 5.8 um on 11 spores, which places this in G. badipes.  Smith and Singer split some species based on the spore length, as a measurement on 2-spored or 4-spored basidia, with the shorter spores making a species a 4-spore basidia, and longer spores from a 2-spored basidia.  Since these are clearly longer than 10 um, that makes this G. badipes and not G. cedretorum (which shares many of the same characters, except the fibrous veil zone).</p>
<p>So, with the incurved cap, fusoid-ventricose cheilo- and pleuro- cystidia, wrinkled, pointed, dextrinoid spores with a plage, white fibrous zone in middle of stipe, and spores longer than 10 um, that makes these G. badipes.

"Cortinarius","2007-12-01 00:00:00 +0000","<p>There is a section of the Galerina monograph, which are species that intergrade with Cortinarius.  I had found these up in Mendocino, and they are the only ones I&#8217;ve seen so far that look like both a Galerina and a Cort. at the same time.</p>
<p>So, taking a look at these under the scope.  The first micro-shot is of the gill edge in Meltzer&#8217;s at 400&#215;.  And these have a fertile gill edge, with no cystidia.  And it turns out these don&#8217;t have cystidia anywhere.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of spores at 1000x from the stipe apex.  And these spores are warted.  Not with a wrinkled surface with a plage.  These are cort. spores not Galerina.</p>
<p>The difference between warted and wrinkled is pretty subtle.  And I hate to say, well just trust me, and there are probably spores where you won&#8217;t be able to tell the difference.  It would be good to able to take a better photo, where the difference can be clear.  Not sure how to do that.</p>

"Galerina","2007-12-29 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Ok, this might be the last one id&#8217;ed for the Dec 2007 Pt. Reyes mycoblitz (by me at least&#8230;).  This in is clearly a Galerina.  But in terms of Smith and Singer, it is an unknown species.</p>
<p>I took this one off the id table in the red barn there, so I don&#8217;t know where they came from or the habitat.  Although with the number of bent stipes, they grew on the top and edge of something, so probably on the side of a fallen dead log.  Mostly they are brown and Galerina like.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of a gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here the cheilocystidia are finger like, and sub-acute blunt ends.  The spores are strongly dextrinoid.  Also pleurocyst. were observed.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the cap surface at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  This one is kinda interesting, there isn&#8217;t any pileocyst. obs. here.  The hyphae here don&#8217;t appear to be in a gelatin matrix, but they might be on top of a gelatin matrix.  But the intersting thing here, is that the surface hyphae are not radially aligned.  The hyphae are in a single sruface layer, but in this layer they are interwoven.  This is a feature I haven&#8217;t seen in other Galerinas where surface hyphae tend to be mostly radially aligned, with little random wander.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of spores from the stipe apex in KOH at 1000&#215;.  Here the spores are kinda different than others in Galerina in that they are not pointed, but oblong.  Also the exosporal covering is very loose in these, and pulled away from the spore in a kinda loose wrinkled bag the spore sits within.  The monograph has a section of &#8220;calyptrate&#8221; spored species, where the exosporal covering pulls away, but not like this, there they describe it pulling away from the plage area, and connected tight to the spore at the apex.  Also the calyptrate section is Galerinas that look like Cortinarius, and these don&#8217;t look like that.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve gone through the Smith and Singer monograph, and I believe these aren&#8217;t in there (but not sure, I&#8217;ll be more confident as I look at more samples).  Perhaps something like these is described in another source, but other than a section in Fungi of Switzerland, and some work done by a guy at Univ. of Oslo, there isn&#8217;t much else out there on Galerina.</p>","Point Reyes National Seashore, Marin Co., California, USA",38.0848,-122.8675,"","Moss Bells","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60658976","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97009032/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60658976,"Galerina","Fungi",118297,0,0,"2007-12-29","2007-12-29","","UTC",22489,22489,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 22:46:01 UTC","2020-10-06 23:15:46 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC-ND",NA,NA,"false"
"Conocybe tenera","2007-12-29 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Two really little guys, given to me in the hopes they might be Galerina, but pretty quickly, could see they are not.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the pileipellis in radial section (that curled around after cut and mounteded), at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The cap surface here is clearly hymeniform, and not a cutis.  So this along makes it a Conocybe instead of a Galerina.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The cystidia here are capitate, with fat rounded bottoms (is it ok to say that?).  The capitate cystidia make this a Conocybe and not a Pholiotina (it case you want to split off Pholiotina as a genus).  Which matches since the stipe does not have an annulus, and I believe Pholiotinas have a small membranous annulus.  Like Conocybe filaris is really a Pholiotina.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was thinking at some point I would try to get these to species, but I&#8217;m not sure that is going to happen anytime soon, so I thought I would just pops these up here for now.</p>
<p>7/12/2008 &#8211; Getting back to these, not sure why I was going through some stuff orgaqnizing, and this one caught my eye.  I had looked at this under the scope again on March 23, but never really got around to cleaning it up and getting it organized.</p>
<p>But here are some more micro-shots of this one.  The third micro-shot here is of some caulocystidia from the apex of the stipe at 400x in KOH.  Here the cystidia can be seen as similar to the cheilocystidia, and also there are no cystidia of other shapes, or fibrous hyphae.</p>
<p>The fourth micro-shot is off some spores from the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  The spore size from these is  10.20 +/- 0.26 (err 0.13) um, width &#8211; 6.89 +/- 0.44 (err: 0.20) um &#8211; q : 1.49 +/- 0.08, on 6 spores.  Which isn&#8217;t that many spores, the caps aren&#8217;t that mature, so this will have to be good enough for jazz.</p>
<p>Looking at this, and going to the best source on Conocybe that I have, which is the Flora Agaricina Neerlandica vol. 6, it looks like these are Conocybe tenera.  This might be a fairly good match, the spore size gets you to a set of Conocybe (along with having no veil), and it seems that the other Conocybe will have fibrous hyphae on the stipe, or caulocystidia of different shape intermixed with cystidia similar to the cheilocystidia.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m going to go with this one.

"Pholiota aurantioflava","2007-12-29 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Ok, from the mycoblitz id party at Berkeley, these were given to me was possible Galerina.  And at the time I thought they were, and first pass under the scope I thought they were.  They have a viscid cap, nice orange-yellow-brown colors, this stipe darkening from the base, somewhat umbonate, macroscopically they look good to be a Galerina.  But they are not&#8230;</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the cheilocystidia on the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The cystidia look a bit like Galerina cystidia, with half of them capitate.  But half of them are not, they are straight and acute.  And it is weird to be half and half.  Also adding to this, the spores are non-dextrinoid.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the cap cuticle, which is a thick ixocutis, of hyphae interwoven in a gelatin matrix.  Very viscid guys.  This is at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot of some spore from the stipe apex in KOH, at 1000&#215;.  The spores are ellipsoid, non-pointed and smooth.  No exosporal covering.</p>
<p>The macroscopic all looks good for Galerina, except with a thicker stipe and viscid they should have a fiberous annulus, and they don&#8217;t, but there are a few that don&#8217;t listed in the monograph.  The capitate cystidia looks good for Galerina, but the spores give it away.  A Galerina that looks like this would have dextrinoid spores, pointed, and roughened.  Since these are non-dextrinoid, ellipsoid and smooth, this is a Pholiota.</p>
<p>Looking in the Hessler and Smith monograph of Pholiota, on page 87, there is P. aurantioflava.  Which in the comments they say looks to be a species that intergrades with Galerina.</p>
<p>After getting to Pholiota I notice that the gills are rather yellow-brown, and too yellow to really be Galerina, which should have tipped off Pholiota from the start, with the viscid cap and yellowish gills.</p>

"Galerina semilanceata","2007-12-29 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Ok, this one, I&#8217;ve had a long history with this one now, and its escaped clear id, because &#8211; it does <b>not</b> have clamp connections.  Which is just the craziest character for id, thanks to Smith and Singer.  Mostly because for most mushrooms, in most places &#8211; you aren&#8217;t going to see clamp connections.  But if the &#8216;shroom has clamps, the place you are going to see them is in the small outer fibrous hyphae, that can grow without restriction.  In the Galerina now I&#8217;ve found the place to be sure is in the fibrous hyphae coating the base of the stipe.  There in the small free hyphae, if there are clamps they will be there for every cell wall.  In these they are not there for these hyphae.  This puts these into section Tubariopsis (which makes sense I guess, since these guy look a bit like Tubaria.)</p>
<p>But to make matters worse, for these, the cell septum in the hyphae at the top of the stipe, tend to be at an angle to the hyphae growth, and at the edges of the angled septum, the cell walls tend to bulge outward.  With the cell wall at an angle, and the hyphae bulging at the ends, this can look like clamps.  But after looking at quite a few of these, in comparison to other Galerinas, it is not.</p>
<p>Anyway, no clamps here, fine, once you decide on that, then the id falls out in the Smith and Singer monograph of Galerina, and these are G. heterocystis.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the cheilocysitida on the non-fertile gill edge.  Here they are capitate (with little round ends), or even tibiiform (with long narrow necks), but a few of the cystidia are acute.  There are no pleurocystidia seen (figuring out how to not see those is another story too&#8230;).  This shot is at 400x of a gill edge in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Another nifty fact here is that the spores are non-dextrinoid, or very weakly dextrinoid when mature and in mass.  This is different than other sections of Galerina where mostly the spores are strongly dextrinoid.  This is probably a better character for this section, than lack of clamp connections.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the caulocystidia on the stipe apex, at 400x in KOH.  I just include this because it is a kinda neat photo.  Also, caulocystidia can be seen the whole length, to the base of the stipe.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of the spores from the stipe apex in KOH at 1000&#215;.  Here the spores are ellipsoid, and sub-pointed, where other section of Galerina the spores are usually pointed.  Also here the spores are finely warted/wrinkled, and over the whole surface.  There is no plage seen.  This spore shape would also be a good way to separate this section, instead of the lack of clamp connections.</p>
<p>5/14/2008 -</p>
<p>Updating this to G. clavata.  I still need to go back to the G. clavata stuff I&#8217;ve looked at and verify that they are 4-spored basidia, to make sure they are not G. subclavata.  They are not G. heterocystis sensu. Smith and Singer, since the cystidia and spores don&#8217;t quite agree there, but agree well with G. clavata (which for some reason is not in Smith and Singer).

"Galerina vittiformis","2007-12-29 00:00:00 +0000","<p>More galerinas from the mycoblitz.  This one has long pointed cheilo and pleuro cystidia, also the cap edges are straight when young (I hate that character&#8230;), which puts this into the section Galerina.  Also on these there is caulocystidia all the way down the stipe to the base (not just at the apex), and no veil at all.  This puts it into stirps Vittaeformis.</p>
<p>The common species in this stirps are G. vittaeformis, and G. atkinsoniana, and differ in that the later has pileocystidia on the cap surface.  These do not have pileocystidia, and that makes these G. vittaeformis.</p>

This day it was raining, so there is not much evidence of that.</p>
<p>But this is a galerina with clear and long pleurocystidia.  Also the caps have margins which are incurved to the stipe when young.  This puts it into the section Naucoriopsis, and the cap is non-viscid, and there isn&#8217;t a clear annulus, so that puts it into stirps Cedretorum.  But with the fibrous zone, and the long pleurocystidia, that makes this G. badipes.  Also this is a 2-spored species.  But in the monograph there is some confusion between G. badipes, and G. cedretorum (and its many varients), where the later doesn&#8217;t have the fibrous zone, and is a 4-spored species.  Although there is the 2-spored varient of G. cedretorum, and the authors admit in the notes, they aren&#8217;t sure how to tell the difference.  So, thanks&#8230;</p>
<p>In anycase, G. badipes has a large variation in the length of the pleurocystidia, and as can be seen in the first micro-shot, the pleurocystidia here are long.  This shot is at 400x of a squashed gill in Meltzer&#8217;s, and the pleurocystidia are about 75 um long.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of spores from the stipe apex in KOH at 1000&#215;.  Here the spores are clearly wrinkled, and if you look closely you can see the plage, with a raised rough edge.</p>","Point Reyes National Seashore, Marin Co., California, USA",38.0848,-122.8675,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60658811","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97008774/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60658811,"Galerina badipes","Fungi",118292,0,0,"2007-12-29","2007-12-29","","UTC",22489,22489,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 22:44:14 UTC","2020-09-24 22:44:21 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"
"Galerina marginata","2007-12-29 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Found on the Pt. Reyes micoblitz.  Now after looking at a few dozen &#8220;Galerina&#8221; samples (and Conocybe, Pholiotina, Tubaria, Psilocybe and Pholiota too&#8230;), I&#8217;ve got some id&#8217;s here.</p>
<p>This one is G. unicolor, which is in the G. autumnalis/G. marginata &#8220;group&#8221;.  At least in terms of Smith and Singer, Galerina of North America, 1964.  These stirps are similar species that are small, brown, have a clear annulus, growth on woody debris, and a light brown spore print.  The two stirps are separated by the cap cuticle, it is viscid in the G. autumnalis stirps, and not in the G. marginata stirps.</p>
<p>These are not viscid, and have a cap cutis.  This is seen in the second micro-shot.  This is of the cap surface in radial section, in Meltzer&#8217;s at 400&#215;.  The suface hyphae are aligned, with no gelatin matrix.</p>
<p>The spores are displayed in the third micro-shot, this is at 1000x in KOH, and the spores are from some veil tissue.  The spores have a wrinkled surface, and it cal almost be seen that they have a plage, with a rough edge.  This is easier to see comparing a few spores while adjusting the focus in and out, but hard to photograph clearly.  The spore sizes here are  9.8 &#215; 5.7 microns on 23 spores measured.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot here is of cheilocystidia, and this is at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here the cystidia are ventricose and sub-acute (fat bottom, thiner necks, and blunt ends).  There are also pluerocysidia on the gill edges, but I didn&#8217;t include a photo of those.</p>
<p>With the pleurocystidia, wrinkled spores, a clear plage, a clear annulus, glabrous hygrophanous cap, and no pileocysidia, and non-viscid, this puts it in the stirps G. marginata.  The size and shape of the spores and cystidia, and the whitish annulus with whitish fibers below, puts this as the species G. unicolor.</p>
<p>But after all that, in recent molecular work, G. unicolor along with G. autumnalis were equated with G. marginata.  But I&#8217;ll list this as G. unicolor, since it is a better match for that taxon in the Smith and Singer monograph.</p>","Point Reyes National Seashore, Marin Co., California, USA",38.0848,-122.8675,"","Funeral Bell","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60658798","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97008739/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60658798,"Galerina marginata","Fungi",154735,0,0,"2007-12-29","2007-12-29","","UTC",22489,22489,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 22:43:53 UTC","2020-09-24 22:44:00 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"
"Fungi","2007-12-29 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Getting back to some weird ones in the past season that I couldn&#8217;t put a genus on.  These I found as part of the Pt. Reyes Mycoblitz this year.  They were found on the woody debris of a really rotten conifer log, near the bottom where the wood was falling apart.  There were 30-40 of these small caps there.</p>
<p>They are off-white creamy, with light yellow-brown gills, mostly from the spore color.  They are small, the big one there is 5-7 mm in diameter, the stipes are less than 1 mm wide.  The caps are glabrous, and non-striate.</p>
<p>No one there had any idea what these might be.</p>
<p>Looking under the scope, the cap is a cutis, of fairly inflated hyphae.  The spores are strongly dextrinoid, there are ventricose-capitate cheilocystidia, no pleurocystidia obs.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot here is 400x under Metlzers of the pileipellis.  This displays the cutis, and some dextrinoid spores.  The second micro-shot is 400x of a gill edge under Meltzers.  This shot displays the cheilocystidia.  The third shot is 1000x under KOH, of spores from the stip apex.</p>
<p>The spores are warted/roughened, no germ pore.  And I&#8217;m pretty sure on a few, I see a plage.   The ave spore size is 9.68 &#215; 5.77 microns on 13 spores.</p>
<p>So, from the micro-details, this all pretty much points to Galerina.  But I wonder if I just have Galerina on the mind.

<p>So, this pretty much agrees with the pub. description for C. fallax.  Except for the width of the spores.  The length of the spores is a little long 4.73 +/- 0.30 compared to 4.44 +/- 0.24, but those are consistant.  The width was found here to be 3.59 +/- 0.24, compared to 3.05 +/- 0.12 that was pub., which aren&#8217;t really consistent.  This makes me wonder a bit if I choose a little large in the measurements of size, and that small error shows up in determinations of very short distances like this&#8230;  Anyway, it is close enough given everything else.</p>
<p>So, this one is a good obs. of C. fallax for California.  The main feature it seems for C. fallax is the veil, where it is a flaring, persistent, membranous veil.  There are a number of obs. that are labeled as C. fallax here, that I don&#8217;t think they are.  There is also a note in the study that C. fallax is rusty brown, and never yellow-ocher.  I think a number of C. fallax obs. here, esp. from Mendocino area, are not, but some other Cystoderma species.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60656978","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97005988/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60656978,"Cystoderma fallax","Fungi",475632,0,0,"2007-12-31","2007-12-31","","UTC",703,703,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 22:24:39 UTC","2020-09-24 22:24:47 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

This time I was able to get it under the scope.

There are also macro features that are different, but these seem more subtle, tones of brown, presences of yellow on stipe, taste is bitter or not, and such.</p>
<p>Anyway, the micro shot here is of a gill edge at 400&#215;.  The gill edge is clean and undamaged showing the basidia and budding spores, but there are no cystidia here.  I looked up and down two gill edges, and no cystidia were found.</p>
<p>Otherwise these only differ from the description of T. manzanitae is that they were found under live oak, but some small manzanita might have been near by.

For the most part A. phalloides in CA has been seen with coastal live oak, although there have been rumors of being found under other hosts.  I found A. phalloides in three places in the preserve this week, and two of spots were under live oak, where I have found them before.  But the photos here are of the third spot, where I haven&#8217;t found them before.  Here I found them under black oak, as you can see in the in situ photo, the cap is poking up under a layer of black oak leaves.  This is an area of the park where live oak is rare, and other trees dominate, mostly C. bay and madrone in this area, with scattered black oak and valley oak.  There was a live oak near by, a few trees over, but I paced it out and it was about 35 feet away.  Which isn&#8217;t too far, but a bunch of C. bay and madrone were closer to this black oak.  The A. phalloides here were scattered among the roots of the black oak, so make what you will of that.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","Deathcap","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60656649","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97005418/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60656649,"Deathcap","Fungi",52135,1,0,"2007-12-16","2007-12-16","","UTC",703,703,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 22:21:04 UTC","2020-09-25 21:49:57 UTC","research","",NA,NA,"false"

"Galerina","2007-12-01 00:00:00 +0000","<p>These were found at the edge of a grassy area, in among some moss, but also small woody debris.  One of the caps was found attached to the woody debris, but it was not sure if these were attracted to the grass, moss or woody debris.  In general it seems Galerinas like all three, but different species like different amounts of each.</p>
<p>Anyway, these had light brown caps, and long fibrous stipes which darken from the base.  There was no evidence of any veil  on the stipe, although the stipe does have long fibrous hyphae on it, there isn&#8217;t a fibrous zone at the top.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot shows the cheilocystidia at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The cystidia are not capitate, and not clubbed.  They are finger-like with wavy side walls.  This also displays the spores are long and narrow, and dextrinoid.</p>
<p>The second shot is of a radial section of the cap at 400x under water.  The cap surface does not display a gelatin layer, and the parallel hyphae of the cutis.  But also important there are no pileocystidia displayed here.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of a spore at 1000x under oil in KOH.  This spore was taken from the stipe surface.  The spore is long and narrow, 11.3 &#215; 6.1 um on 10 spores measured.  Also the spore is only slightly roughened.</p>
<p>This, with the &#8217;shroom size, make this G. vittaeformis, and beyond that, in the Smith and Singer monograph this is also the form vittaeformis of the species.  (There are other forms.)</p>
<p>This species is closely related to G. atkinsoniana, which is comparable to all features, except the pileipellis displays many pileocystidia.  This surface of cystidia on the cap I&#8217;ve been told can be seen in the field with a hand lens, although I haven&#8217;t found these yet.</p>","Albion, Mendocino Co., California, USA",39.22805,-123.758,"","Moss Bells","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60656177","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97004611/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60656177,"Galerina","Fungi",118297,0,0,"2007-12-01","2007-12-01","","UTC",2230,2230,"","","false",NA,NA,734334,"2020-09-24 22:16:18 UTC","2020-09-24 22:35:13 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"
"Galerina marginata","2007-12-01 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Found in the grass, no moss present.  Because they were in grass, I thought that perhaps they were not G. autumnalis, but were in the same group (sensu. Smith and Singer).  They have the macroscopic look of G. autumnalis, with the fiberous stipes that darken from the base, a fibrous zone form the veil, the &#8220;bell-shaped&#8221; cap, which are not umbonate, flat on top, with caps that curl inwards, and have margins that point back towards the stipe when young, and hygrophanous caps that are slightly striate at the margin.</p>
<p>But G. autunmalis should be found on wood, and these are in grass.  But when I went through the micro-details, they are just G. autumnalis (even though I tried to make them something else).  The grassy area was at the edge of a conifer forest, and near by a fallen log, I would have to assume the ground contained quite a bit of woody debris.  G. autumnalis is usually found on well rotten wood, not freshly fallen stuff, and the ground under the grass must have a lot of well rotten stuff.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the cheilocystidia, at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The cystidia are the classic autumnalis shape, sub-pointed, and some club-shaped, but not capitate.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of a radial section of the cap, displaying the cap surface.  There is a gelatin layer on the surface, with the hyphae loosely embedded.  The hyphae are hyline, and not thickened.  These features really make it G. autumnalis sensu. Smith and Singer.  If there was no gelatin layer, it would be in the G. marginata group, and if the hyphae were colored it would be G. unicolor (which for some reason is the only species they described which can or can not display a gelatin layer).</p>
<p>The last micro shot displays the spores trapped in the fibrous veil tissue.  The spores are clearly roughened, as others in the autumnalis group, compared to other Galerinas.</p>
<p>Ok, after all that, note on DNA studies.  There were studies done a few years ago, that state G. autumnalis, G. marginata, G. unicolor, and others, are all the same species.  In the Smith and Singer monograph of NA Galerina, these species are really separated by the qualities of the pileus surface.  The spore sizes, roughness, veil features, and cystidia for these species named in the DNA studies are comparable.  This suggests that the gelatin layer, and hyphae thickness and color of the pileipellis are just species variations.  That study suggests that all these species be named G. marginata, since that is the oldest name.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going with G. autumnalis for now, until I can find more comparible samples which only differ in qualities of the cap surface.</p>
<p>These were dried and placed in the SFSU herbarium for further study in the future.</p>","Albion, Mendocino Co., California, USA",39.22805,-123.758,"","Funeral Bell","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60656157","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97004575/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60656157,"Galerina autumnalis","Fungi",154735,0,0,"2007-12-01","2007-12-01","","UTC",2230,2230,"","","false",NA,NA,734334,"2020-09-24 22:16:00 UTC","2020-09-24 22:16:07 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

"Gymnopilus croceoluteus","2007-12-01 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Ok, these took a couple hours to id.  It was during the lab time of the bio 800 course at SFSU.  The id was mostly confirmed by Dr. Desjardin as part of this lab time.<br />
For the id, we used the 1956 monograph of NA Gymnopilus, by Hesler.</p>
<p>The main features are the smooth orange-brown cap, and the dark smooth stipe without any veil.  Also there are the warted spores, which are 7.5 &#215; 5.4 um, on 7 spores measured.  The shape of these with the pointed tear-drop closely matches the drawing for this species.  In the monograph, the features match well either G. liquiritiae or G. croceoluteus (and there is some mention of G. oregonesis), and says that G. liquiritiae is the &#8220;common&#8221; species, with samples seen from many places in NA, including CA.  But that the feature that separates the species is the &#8220;interwoven pileus trama&#8221;.  This can be seen in the third photo.  This is a &#8220;crown section&#8221;, taken from a thin slice on center top of the pileus, but the interwoven trama was confirmed from radial and marginate sections also.  The trama tissues here can be seen to be randomly aligned, and interwoven.  G. liquiritiae should have radially aligned pileus trama tissues.</p>
<p>The NW key concil for Gymnopilus mentions both these species, and has some feature that separates them.  But until I start finding G. liquiritiae, I can&#8217;t really say how closely these are related, and how the feature might differ.</p>
<p>These were dried and placed in the SFSU herbarium for further study in the future.</p>","Albion, Mendocino Co., California, USA",39.22805,-123.758,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60655906","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97004225/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60655906,"Gymnopilus croceoluteus","Fungi",517829,0,0,"2007-12-01","2007-12-01","","UTC",2230,2230,"","","false",NA,NA,734334,"2020-09-24 22:13:42 UTC","2020-09-24 22:13:47 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

She would sit in my lap to eat on occasion....or jump up on the back yard picnic table to have lunch with me.
