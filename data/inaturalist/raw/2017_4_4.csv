Only found in localized areas of alkali mudflats with fine wet alkali mud - i.e. on Gaines Island, the channel there, and also in the extensive alkali flats along the east shore (all difficult places to get to!). They must have extremely high salt tolerance. Photos included in this record span all year - the burrows were photographed in late March/early April. The adult excavating a burrow was april 4, nice photos of adults were 8/27/17. The (presumed) larval burrows did not form the chimney shape. Not sure if these are subspecies echo or pseudosenilis.

We marked 222 snails the first evening (and it only took 1/2 hour!), and caught 183 the next evening, 55 of which had been marked the night before.  This lead to an estimate of about 732 snails in this yard.  

Happy to share my paper about it to the interested.

""Basal internode of branch > subtending nodal sheath,"" for example.  "">"" means ""longer"" here, right?  If so, that's true.  
If the the whorl of little twig-like things coming out at the nodes of the sterile stem are what is referred to as ""branches,"" and if these can be said to be ""regular,"" then it keys out to E. arvense.  

Note that in the 4th photo here the green stuff in my hand is presumably spores.  Does anyone know if this species has green spores?  It's a feature used later on in the key to distinguish species with white spores vs. green spores, so it may be helpful to know in this case.
