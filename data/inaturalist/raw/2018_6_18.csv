Sea anemones attach themselves to rocks by means of suction-cup-like oral discs. They can walk and even jump. When anemones feel threatened they retreat into stumps anchored on rocks, coral or the sea bottom. Some species can survive out of water for several hours during low tide by retaining water in their body cavity. Sea anemones are often found in tidal pools.
