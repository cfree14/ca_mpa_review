"Vireo gilvus","2018-05-13 09:42:00 -0700","Warbling Vireo (Vireo gilvus), photographed  at Bowers Park in Santa Clara, CA.  This bird was feeding hyperactively in the Chinese elms near the park's restrooms, so it was very difficult to get a halfway discernible shot of it.  Although this shot overexposes the bird slightly, one can still see its key field marks:  

(1) The relatively thick, dull gray bill (rendered a bit fuzzy here because of the bird's motion); 
(2) The white supercilium above each eye, barely visible here because of the lighting, but visible nonetheless; 
(3) The relatively dark eyeline that runs through the eye, but fades out before reaching the bill; 
(4) Dull grayish to brownish upperparts,with no wing bars or other markings aside from those mentioned for the face;
(5) Grayish to whitish breast, with no markings whatsoever;
(6) Slight yellowish wash to the bird's belly, flanks, and undertail coverts;
(7) Brown tail, with little primary extension beyond the vents.

The brownish tinge to its upperparts, most evident in the wings, tail, and scapulars, says that this bird is part of the western population of Warbling Vireos.  (The eastern population usually exhibits grayish upperparts.)","Bowers Park, Santa Clara, CA",37.3592829295,-121.9734415412,"Bowers Park, Rank 3, Santa Clara, Santa Clara County, Vireo gilvus, Warbling Vireo","Warbling Vireo","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/12436730","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/17936073/medium.jpg","arnel",12436730,"Warbling Vireo","Aves",17394,1,0,"2018/05/13 9:42 AM PDT","2018-05-13","2018-05-13 16:42:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",4,4,"","open","false","","",29323,"2018-05-14 01:47:23 UTC","2018-05-17 05:56:40 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
