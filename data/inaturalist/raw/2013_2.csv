"Nematomorpha","2013-02-24 12:06:28 -0800","Nematomorpha (sometimes called Gordiacea, and commonly known as horsehair worms or Gordian worms) are a phylum of parasitoid animals superficially morphologically similar to nematode worms, hence the name. They range in size in most species from 50 to 100 centimetres (20 to 39 in) long and can reach in extreme cases up to 2 metres, and 1 to 3 millimetres (0.039 to 0.12 in) in diameter. Horsehair worms can be discovered in damp areas such as watering troughs, swimming pools, streams, puddles, and cisterns. The adult worms are free living, but the larvae are parasitic on beetles, cockroaches, orthopterans, and crustaceans.[1] About 351 species are known[2] and a conservative estimate suggests that there may be about 2000 species worldwide.[3] The name &quot;Gordian&quot; stems from the legendary Gordian knot. This relates to the fact that nematomorpha often tie themselves in knots.[4]","Laguna Niguel, California, United States",33.540966,-117.730693,"Elements_Organizer, Nematomorpha, Gordian Worms, 022413, Aliso and Wood Canyons","Horsehair Worms","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/7326070","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/9489633/medium.jpg","alazere",7326070,"Gordian Worms","Animalia",63142,0,0,"2013-02-24 12:06:28","2013-02-24","2013-02-24 20:06:28 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false",NA,"",475845,"2017-08-03 00:22:33 UTC","2017-08-03 00:22:35 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

Cap: When I first spotted this it looked white, like a huge piece of popcorn. As it aged it darkened. It looked like baked meringue cookie, 6cm wide, 3-4cm tall, it felt very firm like a rubber ball (those bouncy Superballs), after I cut it (very dense with a rubber eraser like texture) in 1/2 it discolored to pinkish-brown within a few minutes

Latex: none

Gills: none

Stalk: ?

Now that I'm looking at the cross-section it looks like the lower part of this specimen may be a ""Stalk,"" like the more common puffball. Any comments about this are appreciated!

Spores: ?

"Vinca major","2013-02-27 13:30:26 -0800","Vinca plants are subshrubs or herbaceous, and have slender trailing stems 1–2 m (3–6 feet) long but not growing more than 20–70 cm (8-30 inches) above ground; the stems frequently take root where they touch the ground, enabling the plant to spread widely. The leaves are opposite, simple broad lanceolate to ovate, 1–9 cm (0.25–3.5 inches) long and 0.5–6 cm (0.25–2.25 inches) broad; they are evergreen in four species, but deciduous in the herbaceous V. herbacea, which dies back to the root system in winter.
The flowers, produced through most of the year, are salverform (like those of Phlox), simple, 2.5–7 cm (1–3 inches) broad, with five usually violet (occasionally white) petals joined together at the base to form a tube. The fruit consists of a pair of divergent follicles; a dry fruit which is dehiscent along one rupture site in order to release seeds.[5][6]","Berkeley, CA",37.8667228532,-122.2494542599,"","greater periwinkle","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/206721","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/262332/medium.jpg","elliot_goldstein310",206721,"Greater Periwinkle","Plantae",53326,2,0,"February 27, 2013 1:30:26 PM PST","2013-02-27","2013-02-27 21:30:26 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false","","",12922,"2013-02-28 04:30:50 UTC","2016-04-06 16:42:01 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,2,"false"

It spends a lot of time on the very top of one of the taller neighborhood trees, and I wouldn't have given it a second glance were it not being divebombed by a pair of crows one afternoon. Twice now I've seen this bird dining on a mouse or small bird such as a sparrow, and whenever it flies near any of the other neighborhood trees, every bird in the tree scatters.

The missile-like trajectory of its flight, its size (smaller than a crow, bigger than a kestrel), its diet, and its banded tail lead me to believe it might be a merlin, but if anyone else could back me up on that, it would be much appreciated.","Belle View @ Hayes, Petaluma, CA",38.2241008138,-122.646933496,"merlin falcon petaluma winter","Merlin","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/205192","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/260415/medium.jpg","billyverde",205192,"Merlin","Aves",4672,2,0,"2013-02-24","2013-02-24","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",52,10000,"","open","false","","",7448,"2013-02-25 07:35:36 UTC","2018-01-01 15:13:45 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

Mid-length needles, around 5 cm. (longer than a fir, shorter than Jeffrey). 

It looks like some bundles of 5 leaves are in the photo.

The needles struck me as too short for a Sugar Pine, though my experience was with the ones in dry southern California.

If true, this seems to leave P. alibicaulis or P. monticola as the most likely species.

In the upper back there are 2 extra thin white bars within the black that a pure Nuttall's shouldn't have. Otherwise it looked like a pure Nuttall's.  Sounded like a Nuttall's Woodpecker when it called.  

This area is one of the few places in San Diego County where the two species overlap and produce these hybrids.

"Bucephala islandica","2013-02-01 00:00:00 -0800","<html>Seen one courting pair in the channel park today. They prefer the side where there are the least amount of humans. Between Peralta Park and the old Oakland Unified School district headquarters there is a small strip of redwoods and pine trees. No people walk along this stretch of trees because of no established path and maybe a fear that there are homeless people living there which sometimes there is. But the seclusion of the spot has lead it to being a place where the birds I think can feel at ease.  They can escape the hustle and bustle of the Lake Merritt foot traffic and chill out in this part of the channel with some relative peace and quiet. Diving at the inlet under 10th Street for what looked like some kind of shellfish. The spot is right next to where the city has dug a potential mudflat into the Peralta Park. I believe it is a habitat improvement being made with the new channel project. Which is great, but I hope that the plans call for keeping the small section of woods in place as it seems to offer some peace of mind to our feathered friends. A professor at Laney captured some great <a href=""http://rauzon.zenfolio.com/p989996334/h54191cc6#h54191cc6"" target=""_blank"">photos</a> of some courtship behavior.
