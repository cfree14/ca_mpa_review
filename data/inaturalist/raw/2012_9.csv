"Cuculus canorus","2012-09-29 10:23:00 -0500","We just happened to be in the area because we'd been on a Debi Shearwater pelagic trip the previous day. We ran into many other San Diegans (Curtis Marantz, Guy McCaskie, BJ Stacey, etc.) who had driven up the coast just to see this ultra-rare visitor to the CONUS.

Per California Bird Records Committee report 2012-147: COMMON CUCKOO Cuculus canorus (1, 1). A first-fall female Common Cuckoo in Watsonville, SCZ, 28 Sep–2 Oct 2012 (SGe; TABe†, BB†, JLD, TG†, KHa†, MJM†, GMcC, MMe†, DRM†, JMo†, WN†, MR†, DR†, BKS†, PSo†, BJS†, JCS†,
BLS†, STu†, JWt†, CW†; 2012-147; Figure 4; photos published N. Am. Birds 67:184, and cover of W. Birds 44[2]), not only represented a first state record, it was just the second to be found in the contiguous United States. The Common Cuckoo is remarkably difficult to distinguish from the Oriental Cuckoo (C. optatus); where the two co-occur, many cuckoos are left unidentified to the level of species. Adults of both the Common and Oriental are of either a gray or a rufous morph, with the latter restricted to females (Beaman and Madge 1998). One key distinction is that “hepatic” (rufous-morph) females and juveniles of the Common Cuckoo typically lack barring on the rump, while that barring is always present in corresponding plumages of the Oriental Cuckoo (Mullarney et al. 1999). The Santa Cruz bird had the white patch on the nape and narrow white dorsal fringes indicating juvenile plumage (Mullarney et al. 1999), and the rufous of newly molted formative scapular feathers identified it as a hepatic female. Thus the Oriental Cuckoo was excluded primarily on the basis of the unbarred rump, in conjunction with barred alula coverts, thin ventral barring, and lack of contrast on the pale, faintly barred underwing (Howell et al. 2014). The Common Cuckoo is a very rare to casual vagrant to islands in the Bering Sea, primarily in spring and early summer; the only fall record is of a juvenile on the Alaska mainland, 9–11 Sep 2008 (Tobish 2009). Farther afield, additional records have come from Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, 3–4 May 1981 (Baicich 2010), Barbados, 5 Nov 1958 (Bond 1993), and Midway Atoll, northwestern Hawaiian Islands, 23 May 1997 (Pyle and Pyle 2009). The much scarcer Oriental Cuckoo has been recorded 14 times on islands off western Alaska and only once on the mainland (Howell et al. 2014). Curiously, in contrast to the clustering of Common Cuckoo sightings in spring, the large majority of Oriental Cuckoo records extend from late June through early October (Howell et al. 2014). The Oriental Cuckoo could occur in California, but occurrences of both species in Alaska have declined since 2000, perhaps implying a decline in the source population in northeastern Asia (P. E. Lehman in litt.)","Watsonville, CA, USA",36.9138230961,-121.7697965069,"","Common Cuckoo","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/33075444","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/51918183/medium.jpg","buck_fievre",33075444,"Common Cuckoo","Aves",1907,3,0,"2012/09/29 10:23 AM CDT","2012-09-29","2012-09-29 15:23:00 UTC","Central Time (US & Canada)",8,8,"","open","false","","",2276183,"2019-09-20 16:33:32 UTC","2022-01-10 22:35:04 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

Identified by process of elimination -- this doesn't look like either Typha latifolia or Typha angustifolia, the other species in North America.  All three species are also known to hybridize.

Typha domingensis is found worldwide in wetlands at warm-temperate and tropical latitudes.  It is so widely and easily dispersed that it is probably impossible to tell whether individual populations are native or introduced.

This distinctive goldenbush is essentially endemic to the Great Basin and some adjacent mountains of the western United States.  It is almost always found on rock outcrops or rocky slopes, as high as the subalpine zone in some areas.  In the White Mountains it is only known from desert elevations on the east and especially northeast sides, in or facing Nevada.

""With regards to the mantispid, it clearly is not Plega or Climaciella. There is a species, Leptomantispa pulchella, that looks similar to this, but usually (especially when alive) has much brighter abdominal coloration. This image appears to be that of Dicromantispa sayi, a species found commonly in Arizona, but occasionally collected in southern California.

"Hydrocoloeus minutus","2012-09-09 00:00:00 -0800","This juvenile Little Gull was found approximately 8 miles NW of Pt. Pinos while on a pelagic birding trip with Monterey Seabirds. It flew rapidly past the boat several times. This tiny Eurasian gull is a very rare vagrant to California with this individual representing only the fifth ever Monterey County record. 

Key identifying features include its small size, dark crown, collar and ear spot, extensively dark upperparts, dark spots in the secondaries (very faint in this photo), white outer tail feathers, and small, slender bill. 

This bird led to a great deal of discussion and debate on the boat and its ID couldn't be confirmed until photos could be closely examined afterwards. 
Big thanks to Don Roberson and Dan Singer for working through all of the possibilities and helping identify this exciting rarity.

I think that is wrong.); many doors and windows were open; I discovered this - is it a moth? - on the wall of the service porch. I'd never seen such a creature at this location before. I do recall seeing such creatures - very large moths - in the summer of 1984, at night in the LA Colliseum during late night rehearsals of the Opening Ceremonies for the Summer Olympics. There were scores of the moths all over the field, but I did not see any of those close-up. On 9/13/12, when I attempted to relocate the moth outside, it simply crawled onto my hand, then my shirt. When it was on my hand, its wings were spread open, and it vibrated very, very fast. It was gorgeous. I turned off the service porch light, brought it outside and closed the door and released it.
p.s. By the time I tried to identify the moth, and learned of its folklore, it was chilling to read that visits by this moth are considered a harbinger of death by some cultures. Indeed...that turned out to have been true in this specific instance.

Took a walk along the creek today and seen all kinds of neat things, but this one particular observation is very curious to me. My classmates and I are taking a Watershed restoration course at Merritt college with Robin Freeman and today we were surveying the lower end of San Leandro Creek. We were logging some general observations when we noticed that the tide began to flow back out to the bay. Then this dead bird came floating down along with the ebb. What do you all think it is? It was fairly sized, like a small gull or loon. Had a short bill and was white and black.  At first I was like, ""It's a *bleepin'* penquin!"", but of course that would be just silly. Again hope you all are well and as always thank you for your help.
