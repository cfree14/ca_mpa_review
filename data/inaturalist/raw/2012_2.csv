"Balaenoptera acutorostrata","2012-02-26 22:59:50 -0800","Bryde's is very similar to Sei's Whale although somewhat smaller. The diagnostic difference is the number of longitudinal ridges on the rostrum 3 for Bryde's, one for Sei's. Unfortunately this individual surfaced only for very short periods and did not lift it's head out of the water.

Kingdom:Animalia

Bryde's whale or the Bryde's whale complex (/bruːdə/brew-də) putatively comprises two subspecies of rorqual and maybe three. The common Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera e. brydei, Olsen, 1913), a larger form that occurs worldwide in warm temperate and tropical waters, and the sittang or Eden's whale (B. e. edeni, Anderson, 1878), a smaller form that may be restricted to the Indo-Pacific. There is also a smaller, coastal form of B. e. brydei off southern Africa, and perhaps another form in the Indo-Pacific which differs in skull morphology, tentatively referred to as the Indo-Pacific Bryde's whale. The recently described Omura's whale (B. omurai, Wada et al. 2003), was formerly considered a &quot;pygmy&quot; form of Bryde's, but is now recognized as a distinct species.
B. brydei gets its specific and common name from Johan Bryde, Norwegian consul to South Africa who helped establish the first modern whaling station in the country, while B. edeni gets its specific and common name from Sir Ashley Eden, former High Commissioner of Burma (Myanmar). Sittang whale refers to the type locality of the species.

Members of the Bryde's whale complex are moderately-sized rorquals, falling behind sei whales but being larger than Omura's whale and the relatively small minke whales. The largest measured by Olsen (1913) was a 14.95 m (49.0 ft) female caught off Durban in November 1912,[6] while the longest of each sex measured by Best (1977) at the Donkergat whaling station in Saldanha Bay, South Africa, were a 15.51 m (50.9 ft) female caught in October 1962 and a 14.56 m (47.8 ft) male caught in April 1963; both were the offshore form.[8] At physical maturity, the coastal form off South Africa averages 13.1 m (43 ft) for males and 13.7 m (45 ft) for females, while the South Africa offshore form averages 13.7 m (45 ft) and 14.4 m (47 ft). The coastal form near Japan is slightly smaller, with adult males averaging 12.9 m (42.3 ft) and adult females 13.3 m (44 ft). At sexual maturity, males average 11.9 m (39 ft) and females 12 m (39 ft) near Japan. Sexual maturity is reached at 8–11 years for both sexes in the offshore form off South Africa. At birth, they are 3.95–4.15 m (13.0–13.6 ft). The body mass of Bryde's whales can range 12–25 metric tons (13–28 short tons).

This was about the size of a Spotted Sandpiper, but I think the patterning on the back rules that out, plus the facts that it was feeding in a marshy area, wasn't tail pumping, and didn't have the same kind of frenetic flight pattern.  Legs appeared lightly colored to me, as you can kind of see in one of these pics.  I was thinking it might be an immature Pectoral Sandpiper, but even for an immature the bib doesn't seem to come down far enough. Was also considering Bairds, though the legs didn't seem dark eough.  Maybe a Dunlin in transitional plumage could be another option?  Help!  Observed at Don Edwards National Wildlife Refuge, Alviso, CA.
