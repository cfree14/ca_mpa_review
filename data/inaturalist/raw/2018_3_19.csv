Note the circled marking on the epipleuron in the last photo of this observation that is present in all three observations. 

Pic 2 shows the relative abundances of different elytral color patterns of individuals of N. guttula on the West Coast.  All black individuals are most common in Southern California and are still relatively common in the Bay Area. Also, ""all specimens examined which possess a black basal article of the antennal club were from California except for a single specimen from Oregon.""

Although, not evident from the photos, except in one pic, this individual was covered in mites, which is apparently very common in this genus. This beetle was acting very lethargic.

Very tall, sturdy plants at least 3' tall.  Plants emerge from ground level rosettes.  Base leave are lobed, very long (10-12""), and wide (4-5"") at the stem tapering to a point.  Stems are hairy and about 1/2"" at the base, tapering to the flower at the tip.  Stems have several branches, with leaves hugging each branch junction. Leave are fleshy and not hairy. Upper leaves are smaller, non-lobed, and have a pointed tip and widened base that clasps the stem. 
The bright yellow flowers are clustered at stem tops and have four petals that are ¼
to ½ inch long. New buds emerge at the tips and cascade out as they open.

This large open field of mustard was stunning.  The flowers were so bright they almost glowed.
