"Discophyton rudyi","2005-05-25 00:00:00 -0800","Found in a small crevice in the low intertidal at Ragged Point. A single Rostanga pulchra is visible on red-orange sponge in the center of the image. The 3rd image shows the boulder field on the south side of Ragged Point. Scanned from prints made from 35 mm color film.

Specimens collected on this date from this site were deposited in the Invertebrate collection at the California Academy of Sciences (CASIZ 173734).

Ragged Point is just about the southernmost known locality for D. rudyi (in February 2008 I found abundant colonies on the rocky shore 2.8 km to the south, 0.8 km north of the mouth of Arroyo de los Chinos), and in Jan 2018, abundant colonies in the low intertidal a little farther south at Point Sierra Neveda.","San Luis Obispo County, CA, USA",35.7569035161,-121.324596405,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/9432797","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/12822103/medium.jpg","jeffgoddard",9432797,"Discophyton rudyi","Animalia",460061,1,0,"2005-05-25","2005-05-25","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",4,4,"","","false","","",216076,"2018-01-10 21:25:09 UTC","2019-03-17 22:46:19 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
