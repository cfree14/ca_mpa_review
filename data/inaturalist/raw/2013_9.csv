There were two slightly strange cap that came in, from a swampy area at Chapman Creek campground.  I had them in my had briefly in the field, and we tried a number of names for them, but none of them seemed to stick.  They went into someone&#8217;s box, and I forgot about them for the rest of the day, yet another strange unknown, lets move on.</p>
<p>They were 8-10cm high, with connical caps 1-2 cm diameter, 1-2cm high, dull brown, slightly striate on the margin, pale gills, slightly tan, glaborus darker stipe 1-2mm diameter.</p>
<p>After the weekend, Prof. Desjardin got them under the scope back at SFSU, and we had a discussion over e-mail.  Turns out they had lots of thick walled incrusted cystidia.  After going back and forth, the id that was found was Mythicomyces corneipes.  Dennis checked with the original published description, and found it a perfect match.</p>
<p>He then went on to say, this had been found rarely since the 80&#8217;s up at the Yuba Pass, but there wasn&#8217;t a good id on them until now.  He is going to change the id&#8217;s of material from the past also that is in the herbarium.</p>
<p>I thought it would be good to post the story here, even if it got away from me, and I didn&#8217;t get any photo in place.

"Archytas","2013-09-02 21:35:48 -0500","Okay, had a go at bugguide.net. They say it is in the tachinini tribe, an archytas species, not a cactus fly. What seemed odd/off to me was the bristly abdomen, eyes a bit, lighter coloration towards head, antannae, the lack of dark coloration on the wings, and the beak on the face didn't seem quite right. 

The description says these species get to 5/8 inch in length, which is about how large this guy was. Says most of these species lay their eggs on other insects like caterpillars, and the larvae feed parasitically. Okay. Interesting, so it is a species of giant parasitic fly with a life cycle like a tarantula wasp. Didn't know about this whole group of flies, didn't know they existed. Learn something new. Thank you again folk over at bugguide.net, and Norm Woodley for the id clarification.

I have a photo of the other one if anyone wants it (and the higher resolution photo of all 7 of them in one photo).  The photo was taken about 1pm that day.

This is about the time when they were making the news when the IBR had rescued one that had made its way far inland, rehabed it, and let it go.

The temperature was 82F., with a cloud cover of 35%, no precipitation at the time of observation (rain the night before), no wind, aspect NE to N, surrounding vegetation was mostly forest. Both areas of Pika observation (separation of approximately 350 feet) were in anthropogenic material associated with the former road. In one case Pika was observed in a resting state and others were moving in and out of the rip rap or rock fields. They were auditory at times, no haypiles were found and no obvious scat signs.

low tide - exposed mud-sand flat with mixed Zostera marina- Zoobotryon verticillatum (sphagetti bryozoan) community,  I was somewhat surprised to see eelgrass in the back reaches of the artificially created and polluted ""Boat Channel"", San Diego
-
photographs shows the beginning edge of the eelgrass patch.  
-
I am unclear if San Diego bay records are truly Zostera marina, as the systematics and ecology of Pacific west coast Zostera seem very confused - the issue made even more so with the confounding west coast introduction of Zostera japonica.  I grew up in Northern California, and knew Zostera marina from multiple visits to the Northern California shore.  The organism commonly called Zostera marina from San Diego Bay does not resemble the Zostera marina species from San Francisco Bay, and other nearby Northern California bays.  As a question at a seminar, I inquired about the dissimilarity with an eelgrass expert, and did not obtain a clear cut answer.  
-
While I will call the eelgrass species Zostera marina based on multiple, existing San Diego Bay records, I am unsure of the San Diego Bay eelgrass identification until I gain clarification.","Boat Channel, Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD), San Diego Bay, San Diego, California ",32.73654,-117.207627,"Zostera marina, eelgrass, San Diego Bay, San Diego","Eelgrass","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/420664","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/530292/medium.jpg","peabodysherman",420664,"zostera marina","Plantae",52614,0,0,"2013-09-20","2013-09-20","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","open","false","","",20829,"2013-10-07 03:26:08 UTC","2016-12-13 18:31:53 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

"Trachemys scripta elegans","2013-09-07 16:30:00 -0700","Photographed in the Museum's Nature Lab this large example appeared to be a male Western pond turtle. This animal was found by a homeowner a distance from the Santa Ana River in Rubidoux, and brought to the Museum for identification. It was then handed over to the Riverside-Corona Resource Conservation district for release in one the agency's habitat restoration projects. Controversy ensued following this report. Herpetology curator Greg Pauly at the LA Natural History Museum warned that this could be a dark (melanistic) form of Red-eared slider. Kerwin Russell at the RCD checked the details and concurred. One thing that was learned through this experience: the timid behavior reported for pond turtles is not a good field marker, as this animal was extremely docile compared to a typical red-eared slider. For my part, the use of the descriptor ""melanistic"" is misleading as many adult red-ears are darker than this animal, but they retain some forms of bold markings.","Rubidoux, CA",33.99644,-117.39525,"","Red-eared Slider","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/396193","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/495866/medium.jpg","jbryant",396193,"Red-eared Slider (Subspecies Trachemys scripta elegans)","Reptilia",51271,2,0,"2013-09-07 16:30","2013-09-07","2013-09-07 23:30:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","open","false","","",6869,"2013-09-13 18:49:41 UTC","2020-07-29 17:13:32 UTC","research","CC-BY",NA,NA,"false"

Photographs show inhalant (oral) siphon (at 12 o'clock) , and forceful ejection of filtered water by exhalent (atrial) siphon (at 9 o'clock). Photographed tunicate in tray ejected water on a repeating frequency.
-
Most Internet photographs of tunicates do NOT show expelling of water. Thus, for education purposes, I chose the photographs depicting the pumping action by the living tunicate, plus the warty blob tunicate would photograph as a more interesting picture. Tunicates feed by inhaling water, filtering food and oxygen, and blowing filtered water out the atrial siphon. Two images show individual tunicate at rest providing detail of siphons including brown streaking seen on siphons
