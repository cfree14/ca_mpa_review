""Resembling E. ocellea Hodges#5454 in color and maculation but with the whitish patch adjacent to blackish terminal dots somewhat broader; and the thin brownish line within, closer to termination of irrorated area than to the terminal dots... In E. californicalis, the forewing bands are placed at a slightly different angle to the costa than in E. ocellea, and the terminal line dots are bordered proximally by a wide white strip, whereas E. ocelleus has a narrow white strip.""

The whitish patch mentioned above is very broad, broader than than that of most individuals of this species  pictured on BG. The thin brownish line within this patch is indeed closer to termination of irrorated (spotted) area than to the terminal dots (if I'm interpreting this correctly). Also, based off of the pics I've seen,  the angle of the forewing bands to the costa seems a better match for  E. californicalis.","CA-12, Santa Rosa, CA 95405, USA",38.434385,-122.69239096,NA,"California Grass-veneer Moth","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/13438839","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/19722610/medium.jpg","cjs041",13438839,"California Grass-veneer Moth","Insecta",219636,2,0,"2018-06-14 2:40:47 PM PDT","2018-06-14","2018-06-14 21:40:47 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",6,6,"","","false","","",333666,"2018-06-15 01:07:35 UTC","2020-09-22 08:36:35 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,2,"false"
