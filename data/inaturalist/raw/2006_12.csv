"Tricholoma ustale","2006-12-19 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Ok, I don&#8217;t like this id, but it is as close as I get.  I found these by themselves, and it is not quite like anything else I have found there.  It threw off a lot of bright white spores, so I&#8217;m sure it is Tricholoma.  The cap was very viscid and smooth, no scaling going on, so I&#8217;m pretty sure it is not something like imbricatum or vaccinum.  It is not fracticum, although viscid, and right now I can&#8217;t remember if dryophilus is viscid, but it doesn&#8217;t quite look like that.  So it is a brown to brownish capped Tricholoma, but not one I know&#8230; so I am tossing it into the pessundatum gp., like Arora did.  When I can get a copy of the Tricholoma section of Agaricales of CA (why are those so pricy?), I&#8217;ll see if there is one there that matches this better.</p>
<p>1/29/2007 &#8211; ok, I was able to spend some time going over the Agaricales of CA this past weekend, and spent some time in the Tricholoma section.  After going back and forth I found T. manzanitae, which pretty much exactly matched this sample.  Also, this was found in among live oak, but right where a largish patch of manzanita was starting about 15-20 feet away.</p>
<p>And finally, I&#8217;m confused enough, I&#8217;m just going to drop these back to &#8216;sp.&#8217;.  T. manazitae should be white at first, then salmon-orange in color, and dull brown in age.  This does seem to look like the salmon-orange stage.  But it should also have radial scaling on the cap, which this doesn&#8217;t.  So, this one close to T. dryophilum, and T. manzanitae, and I didn&#8217;t spend enough time with the thing to figure it out.  So, I&#8217;m going with &#8216;sp.&#8217; until I find more, probably next year.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60644432","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/96985554/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60644432,"Tricholoma ustale","Fungi",118201,0,0,"2006-12-19","2006-12-19","","UTC",703,703,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 20:17:59 UTC","2020-09-24 20:18:02 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

But old they start to develop a vomit odor.</p>

"Cortinarius evernius","2006-12-09 00:00:00 +0000","<p>These are kinda cute.  They are smallish, about 2-3cm in the cap size, ~10cm long in the stipe.  The spore color is a nice darker brown/rusty brown, so I am pretty sure these are Cortinarius.  They were not visid at all anywhere, the cap are probably hygrophanous, but I didn&#8217;t verify that.  The contina seems to have complete gone away on the stipe, but there seems to have been a universal veil, there are brown veil remenants on the cap edges, and the bottom of the stipes are wooly white with veil remenants.  Kinda neat little guys, found in the duff of a redwood grove.  But no idea about the species.</p>
<p>Feb 23, 2007 &#8211; I just got &#8220;Mushrooms and other fungi of North America&#8221; by Roger Phillips, and I look at the cover, and I think, hey that it my little cort. with wooly stipe right there.  I look inside, and it take a little looking, but I find that on the cover is C. evernius.  Which it turns out is described in Arora also.  The description actually matches well, with the veil remnants on the cap edge, and the white wooly veil on the stipe.  But I had dismissed it do to the size of the cap, and the stalk description says it is equal or narrowed to the base.  This better matches the photos in Phillips.  These seem to be too small, and the stalks are wider at the base.  But the photos do look similar.</p>
<p>In the comments for C. evernius Arora mention C. lucorum as a common conifer lover which differs with a club shaped stem.  These are under D. fir and Redwood, and mostly club shaped, so I will go with that.</p>
<p>Feb. 24, 2007 &#8212; after looking over a google search on C. lucorum, these do look very close, but the photos I found have an abrupt bulb at the base, where these are more smoothly club shaped.  I guess I should just go for the main species in Arora first, before heading to the notes, if I really just can&#8217;t tell the difference here.

<p>But subnigricans is the older name, and it is listed as such in Arora.  Agaricales of CA lists these are R. eccentrica, and states they are a different species from the other R. subnigricans.  They can be told from the usually off-center stipe, the bruising colors which goes very slowly (usually takes 30 mins to complete) to red, to red-brown, and then grey-brown (but not black).  And in the older ones I can tell the odor, which is disgusting&#8230; much like vomit at times.</p>
<p>I created some fresh bruises on the right hand stipe in the photo, and waited 5-10 mins for the red-brown color to deepen for the photo.  But then the stipe was in shadow, so it hard to get the color of the bruise from this photo.  Oh well.</p>

And later when I cut in half, the flesh did not stain blue when bruised.  Only the flesh near the pores very slowly slightly stained blue.  The taste of the flesh was very mild.  One interesting feature, there was a layer of brick/vineasous red under the pileapelus (how do I spell that?).  You can see a little of this in the photo where there are a few nips out of the edges of the pileus.</p>
<p>The species of B. smithii was roughly placed up at Albion, and I took these home to look at the Boletus of CA. online:</p>
<p><a href=""http://mykoweb.com/boletes/index.html"">http://mykoweb.com/boletes/index.html</a></p>
<p>From the field key, B. spadiceus seemed to match these.  It does have the red layer in the cap, and the slightly bluing near to the pores only.  But these are too large for the description, and the red on the stipe is not mentioned.  Also B. fragrans comes close, it better matches size, and has the red on the stipe, but not the red layer in the cap.  Also B. fragrans is listed as only a montane species, that has only rearely been found.  So, none of these are really satisfactory.</p>
<p>But going back to B. smithii, the description does match these rather well, with the red layer in the cap, and esp. with the rad band at the top of the stipe.  But smithii is supposed to blue stain in the flesh, and these didn&#8217;t do that much.  But I was cutting it up 24 hours later, and in other species the blue staining can go away after getting the sample out of ground, so don&#8217;t know.  Also I am used to crysenteron, where the amount of bluing in the flesh is quite variable.</p>
<p>The one place the field key went a little wrong with these, was that they are supposed to have a red/pinkish cap.  In the comments it does mention that they are usually olive/brown/gray in the cap, but this layer wears off as the species grows and the under red layer starts to show through, giving them a pinkish/red cap look.  These are fresh enough to not quite show the red layer in the cap very much.</p>
<p>The description also mentions that these are more common in Oregon and Washington area, but are common enough in the coastal area of CA in Mendocino Co under conifers, but nowhere else in CA.  So, in the end, B. smithii sounds good to me.</p>","Albion, Mendocino Co., California, USA",39.22805,-123.758,"","Smith's Bolete","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60012176","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/95928527/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60012176,"Boletus smithii","Fungi",416423,1,0,"2006-12-09","2006-12-09","","UTC",2230,2230,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-18 21:37:20 UTC","2020-12-23 23:51:09 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC-ND",NA,NA,"false"

"Inocybe brunnescens","2006-12-02 00:00:00 +0000","<p>This one is the big find of the week.  There were a few days of frost, so not much found, most everything all gone this week.  But these were kinda hard to see, only one was just poking up from the oak leaf duff, and only part of the cap.  When I picked it up, I then noticed the other humps nearby, and there were a couple dozen of these in this one area.  They seem to fruit 2-3 inches below ground and push their way up through the dirt and duff.</p>
<p>They are largish size, and at first I thought they were Tricholoma, although I haven&#8217;t see some with this universal veil tissue on the cap like this.  But then looking at the fiberous caps, and the darker gills of the older ones it came to be later &#8211; Inocybe.  At home the spore print was brown confirming it.</p>
<p>Looking it up, with the brown caps, and the white veil tissue on the center of the caps got me to the species.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60011851","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/95927926/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60011851,"Inocybe brunnescens","Fungi",515814,0,0,"2006-12-02","2006-12-02","","UTC",703,703,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-18 21:33:48 UTC","2020-09-18 21:33:54 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

From field notes: 
K. Rogers and I decided to chase after the recently reported Brown Boobies (K. Slauson, R. Hewit). Shortly after arriving at the HSU Marine Lab parking area at 1pm and scoping (Kowa TSN822 20-60x, Leica 20-60x) the near-shore rocks, we both spotted what appeared to be a JUVENILE BROWN BOOBY flying from behind Flat Iron Rock out over the water to the south and then back, disappearing behind the rock. The bird did this about 5 times and then stayed behind the rock. More than likely the bird was looking for a perch and then found one. The bird we saw flying was dark brown above, with a paler brown belly and underwing lining. The bird was long winged with a distinctly pointy head/bill and pointy tail end. We were unable to relocate the bird. (Note: as of 5 Dec this and the following adult bird have been seen simultaneously according to K. Burton & C. Ogan.)

We decided to hike up Trinidad Head to get a better view of the south end of Flat Iron. From a bench area about 100 feet from the pavement end, we scoped the rock and found an ADULT BROWN BOOBY (2:45pm) perched and preening on the south end of the rock. We had excellent views of the bird and observed it for about 15 minutes. Photos are cropped. The adult bird had an obvious white belly with a distinct dark brown chest. The bill was pale yellow. The feet were unseen. The back was uniformly brown. This bird was later sighted by S. Harris, K. Ross, and other Humboldt County birders on 3, 4, & 5 Dec 2006.","Flatiron Rock, Trinidad",41.0594460116,-124.162942143,"","Brown Booby","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/18525088","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/28337300/medium.jpg","cnddb_brian",18525088,"Brown Booby","Aves",3797,2,0,"2006/12/03 2:03 PM PST","2006-12-03","2006-12-03 22:03:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",100,100,"","open","false",NA,"",1341402,"2018-11-20 22:10:26 UTC","2018-11-21 01:51:04 UTC","research","",NA,NA,"false"
