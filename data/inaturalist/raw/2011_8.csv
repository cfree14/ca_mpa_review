"Boletus barrowsii","2011-08-17 16:14:00 -0600","I ate it with wild onion and rice.  I would like to say it was yummy but I happened to have cryptosporidium blooming in my gut which hit me hard that night and made me wonder, ""Was that mushroom edible?"".  It was not the mushroom but rather the wild unfiltered water I had been drinking along with the ten days of antibiotics I had just finished days earlier leaving me with a wide open gut for something like cryptosporidium to bloom in.  Normally they would not be able to get a foot hold with competition from all the usual gut flora.  That totally sucked!

Note that this animal is on the sponge, Acarnus erithacus. The rougher texture of the surface of the sponge in the background and to the left of the slug appears to be a feeding scar. Usually the surface of this sponge is smooth. I hypothesize that the red color of the sponge is what causes the dorsum of this animal to be red-orange in color.

"Lactarius crassus","2011-08-18 00:00:00 -0800","Found this on several occasions over August and September in various parts of this forest. Overall size varied from 4-7 cm across; the stipe was always quite short, 0.5-2 cm long. Pileus slightly centrally depressed in most specimens. Lamellae were considerably distorted, and covered when young by a very thin peridium, which disintegrated in age. The fruiting bodies were pinkish-buff overall when fresh, becoming more brownish in age and when dried. They exuded a scanty, thin, white, unchanging latex. Some specimens had a slightly fruity odor; Gayle Russell, another observer, described it as ""like dried apricots."" The taste was always extremely acrid!
Growing most likely with Abies concolor, but Pinus lambertiana, Pinus ponderosa, Pinus jeffreyi, and in one case Abies magnifica, were present as well.","Stanislaus-Tuolumne Experimental Forest, Tuolumne Co., California, USA",38.1701,-119.99,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/10011252","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/27801012/medium.jpg","theachesney",10011252,"Lactarius crassus","Fungi",1096034,1,0,"2011-08-18","2011-08-18","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",2120,2120,"","","false","","",48,"2018-02-27 00:24:30 UTC","2021-01-29 00:05:10 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC-SA",NA,NA,"false"

Presumably growing with sugar pine (the only five-needled pine in the vicinity) but ponderosa pine and white fir were also present. The ground cover was almost exclusively dead wood and litter, with a few parasitic plants (pinedrops and coralroot). I found several patches of them in the same area over three days.
Pileus yellow and viscid with scattered reddish-brown fibrils. Stipe yellowish, covered in white to pinkish glandular dots that were exuding resinous goo in copious quantities. Both the dots and the resin turned dark brown with handling. The base of the stipe was covered with white, downy mycelium and white rhizomorphs were visible extending into the litter.  Some specimens had an annulus (not visible in the photos), and a few seemed to have veil remnants around the margin of the pileus. The pores were large (1-4 mm) and dull yellowish to yellowish-brown.

Likely a young badger off course or moving through area and startled - went under a resident's car.

SoCo Animal Control has revised and updated policies related to how to respond to future calls with functional options other than taking a gun and killing an innocent badger underneath a car.  (Left alone, the badger would have moved on later that evening.)

"Sceloporus occidentalis","2011-08-13 00:00:00 -0800","A extremely common lizard to be found in California. Also unique is it's defense against Lyme disease.  The lizard has a protein in its blood that kills off Lyme disease. I often will catch these lizards in the spring and early summer to find behind their partial gular folds a horde of tiny sub-adult ticks. One time I found 14 ticks on one lizard. Eventually the ticks will out grow the lizard and come looking for a larger meal, namely myself hiking along the trail. Thankfully enough the lizard has neutralized the potential risk for lyme disease in the ticks. Of course there are still many different vectors for the disease to be spread eg (deer, kangaroo rats, dogs), but none-the-less we can be grateful to our scale blue bellied friends.
