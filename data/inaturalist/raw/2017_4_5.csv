"Sciurus niger","2017-04-05 18:28:00 -0700","Male squirrel lives in pine trees near a work place. He has a home on each side of the building in a pine tree, and also a small palm tree. 
He tends to chatter loudly when the neighborhood cat wanders nearby, often to the point of distraction. (The cat seems to enjoy it) The cat will circle the base of the tree, never climbing, while the squirrel yells loudly.
There is a female near by as well. She is not seen nearly as often. 

If whole nuts are left for them, the male will eat his fill first, then bury a few. 
The female will start burying the nuts right away, and prefers utilizing the planter boxes. 
They are both fond of filberts more so than any others. 
The male is also known to antagonize crows , running from tree to tree, seeming to play a game of catch me if you can.
