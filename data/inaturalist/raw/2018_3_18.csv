Overall this stand is not looking well. From the photos only one pine looks to be in decent condition. These trees are all mature and their location in the wash area of mill creek suggests that they must have had enough water. Now with the recent years of drought the creek must not be supplying enough water and possibly allowing for other threats such as bark beetles, though I did not go close enough to check.
