Under a bush which I believe is <a href=""http://eol.org/pages/583636/overview""><i>Vaccinium ovatum</i></a> (California Huckleberry).  (Leaves included in close-up photo.) Nearest trees were <a href=""http://eol.org/pages/1061712/overview""><i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i></a> (Douglas-fir) and one spindly cedar-like thing I did not recognize but which may have been Incense Cedar.  Although I did not notice pine nearby, second photo shows pine needles in the duff.  This Location has Sugar pine, and one Jeffrey pine (which is probably at least 100 meters from where I collected this mushroom).<br />
This is a young specimen, veil still intact.<br />

In breeding season, shows striking black face and belly with bold black-and-white checkering on upperparts. In nonbreeding season, more uniformly drab gray with white belly. 
Black-bellied Plovers are found on beaches and coastal wetlands of all coasts of North America. Feeds on beaches and mudflats by walking or running, stopping, and pecking at the surface.
Wary and quick to give alarm calls, the Black-bellied Plover acts as a sentinel for groups of foraging shorebirds worldwide. Its quickness to sound the alarm allowed it to resist market hunters during the heyday of shorebird hunting, and the species remained common while other species crashed.
The Black-bellied Plover is the only American plover that has a hind toe on its foot—although the toe is so small it’s hard to see, you can make out this toe in the first photo.","Santa Ana River, Anaheim, CA, USA",33.8567847505,-117.8144936781,"","Black-bellied Plover","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/35066164","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/55271252/medium.jpg","bugornot",35066164,"Black-bellied Plover","Aves",4892,1,0,"2014/01/06 1:19 PM PST","2014-01-06","2014-01-06 21:19:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",488,488,"","open","false","","",2268213,"2019-10-29 22:52:18 UTC","2021-05-14 15:30:27 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

<p>Stipe color: Apically, pale orange-yellow, like light part of pileus, ranging to darker reddish brown basally.</p>
<p>Annulus: Distinct annular zone in younger specimens.</p>
<p>Spores &#8220;reddish-gold&#8221; in color under the microscope (spore deposit not taken), wrinkly outer surface, inequilateral, with distinct plage when seen in full side view, and a strong dextrinoid reaction to Melzer&#8217;s. Distinct layers noticeable in Melzer-stained spores.</p>
<p>Spore size: Length: 7.3-9.8 microns, average = 8.5 +/- 0.87 microns; Width: (5.3) 5.6-6.6 microns, average = 6.1 +/- 0.44 microns. (Based on only a few spores &#8211; will post spore stats based on larger survey soon.)</p>
<p>Hymenium: Cheilocystidia abundant, plurocystidia present but uncommon. Hymenial structures and lamellar trama metachromatic in Congo red.</p>
<p>Comments: I at first thought I saw a very thin apical germ pore in observations of these spores, but images do not seem to bear this out.

"Mytilus californianus","2014-01-04 00:00:00 -0800","<html>Moonstone beach is definitely the visit. The beach is very good place for a day at the beach. Tidepools and a creek for exploring, feldspars for beach coming, sheltered beach for picnicking, and during <i>this</i> January warm sunbathing abounds. I would say that I was most absorbed by my search for the moonstones. We stayed a couple nights in Cambria to unwind after the holiday season, it's a cool town and is worth a visit. Our only criticism was that everything in town shutdown at 9. Probably cause we were visiting, in the off season.  </html>  ","Moonstone Beach, Cambria, CA, US",35.563872,-121.109019,"Moonstone beach, Cambria, CA, Cambria California","California Mussel","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/503080","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/640256/medium.jpg","greenrosettas",503080,"California Mussel","Mollusca",62806,3,0,"2014-01-04","2014-01-04","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false","","",3161,"2014-01-17 06:14:37 UTC","2020-03-31 08:02:25 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
