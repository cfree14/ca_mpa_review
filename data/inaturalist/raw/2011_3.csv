<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The cheilocystidia are lecythiform, with apr. 5um diameter ends.  No pleurocystidia were obs.  Also the basidia were 2-spored, and there were no reactions to the reagent.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the cap surface at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The surface is hymeniform, no pileocystidia.  If you look closely, there is a slight very thin layer of gelatin it seems in the shot.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of the stipe apex at 400x in KOH.  The caulocystidia are rather random, globose, lageniform and filiform mixtures in clumps.  No lecythiform caulocystidia were seen.  Also clamp con. were obs, and no caulocystidia were seen at the base.</p>
<p>The forth micro-shot is of spores on the stipe at 1000x in KOH.  The spores are tan, ellipsoid, smooth, with a germ pore.  The apr. ave. size is 15 &#215; 9.5 um.</p>
<p>Putting this together with the random non-lecythiform caulocystidia, and large spores from 2-spored basidia, you get C. siliginea.  How different this is from C. rickenii is hard to say, they are synonyms in Flora Agarcina Neerlandica vol. 6, but they are kept separate in Hausknecht&#8217;s monograph.  Although they are only separate by very slight differences in size, color and look of the cap surface.  He admits that under the microscope there is no difference.  Macroscopically, I can&#8217;t quite see the difference either, but by his differences, it seem that these are on the side of C. siliginea.  And I&#8217;ve called things like this in California C. siliginea before, so I&#8217;ll keep it there.</p>","Berkeley, Alameda Co., California, USA",37.8713,-122.2805,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60688708","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97061430/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60688708,"Conocybe siliginea","Fungi",416259,0,0,"2011-03-06","2011-03-06","","UTC",5669,5669,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-25 06:21:06 UTC","2020-09-25 06:21:15 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

Though edible these mushrooms contain coprine which blocks acetaldehyde dehydrogenase which is involved in the metabolism of ethanol. Without functioning acetaldehyde dehydrogenase the body builds up the &quot;hangover molecule&quot; acetaldehyde in the blood leading the person to feel horrible. It won't kill you, but like a bad hangover you might wish you were dead.  Coprine takes about 3-5 days to pass out of the body, so if you eat them, don't drink any booze for at least that amount of time.

I generally see this species actively provisioning burrows like these through March, but due to cool weather and lots of rain in recent weeks they've been hard to find. I observed them pushing soil up out of their burrows on March 5. On overcast days afterwards I could see their heads just inside the burrows. During the past week of heavy rains I haven't seen them at all.","McClellan Ranch Park, Cupertino, CA",37.313656145,-122.0648002625,"","Mining Bees","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/13309","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/26423/medium.JPG","mcclellanranch",13309,"Animals","Insecta",57668,0,0,"2011-03-26","2011-03-26","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false",NA,NA,851,"2011-03-27 02:48:39 UTC","2020-01-05 11:37:47 UTC","casual","",NA,NA,"false"

I went to go check it out more closely, and I noticed it was rotting and sort of slimy. There were flies on it. It stank pretty bad, kind of like feces. Next to it I found what I then thought to be 4 puffball mushrooms. I was excited because I had heard puffball mushrooms are usually edible. I brought them home to identify, cut them open and found that they were slimy like Jello on the inside. After doing some book/internet research I discovered for myself that both mushrooms were the same, a species of stinkhorn. I put the four ""eggs"" in my backyard, I'm excited to see if they ""hatch"" into a stinky mess.

I suppose maybe folks like it pinker.

To be fair, the best local specimens are on Wright Street between Benton and College.
