"Eleodes obscura","2018-06-19 10:47:25 -0700","These beetles, in the hot, noon-day sun exhibited very interesting behavior. They were located around some dirt mounds which must have been built from underground (although no animal tracks seen). 
One dominant beetle would patrol a mound, and when it discovered another beetle nearby, it would approach and suddenly jump on its back. I could not see any copulation, but it seemed instead to be a kind of grappling - for domination perhaps. The bottom guy seemed to always scurry away. Then the dominant guy would either wander around the mound, or seek shade -- and if another beetle was encountered, would again jump its back. Interesting behavior.

Does any one know about this behavior or this species' ecology?
