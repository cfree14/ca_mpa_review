"Scapanus latimanus","2018-04-24 03:37:34 -0700","I feel like what happened this night could only happen to me. I had walked outside at 3:30 in the morning to use the astrolabe I made to do some altitude measurements of stars as I have recently been working on honing my celestial navigation skills. I had been doing that for a few minutes when I noticed a small, dark, vaguely potato shaped creature scampering across the street. At this point I pull out my phone, turned on its flashlight, and recognize the creature as a mole. I had to post this on iNat since I had never seen a wild mole before, so I put my astrolabe down, not thinking about if I would be able to find it again, and start chasing this mole around trying to take pictures of it. This was a frustrating process since the mole ran too fast and too far for me to get any good pictures. In the end the mole ran under the serrated leaves of an agave-like plant never to come out. Despite the fact that I didn’t get any good pictures, I feel incredibly lucky to have seen this mole, seeing as I just happened to notice it crossing the street in the middle of the night. I can’t imagine moles cross roads very often. After looking into moles a bit more I have noticed that most observations of moles on iNat are of dead moles so now I feel even more lucky to have made the acquaintance of a live mole. After the mole got away, I went back to where I started and I did manage to find my astrolabe.
