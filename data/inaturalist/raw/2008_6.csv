"Narcissus pseudonarcissus","2008-06-20 18:39:00 -0700","Discovered on a survey by myself, Dave Stith, and James Dillane, which turned out to be a rediscovery of plants originally spotted by Dave five years earlier or so, and spotted by someone else even earlier, in 1998.

The location is not from a GPS point taken at this location; it is estimated from my saved track that did not retain a time stamp.

The location is pretty easy to find, though.  Note the pool of water at lower right in the second pix.

Someone must have planted these here.  There was a mention of them being at Skunk Cabbage Meadow in 1998, so they have been here at least ten years.

The original URL for that report, which included a pix of them in bloom, was:

http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~warrior/photopre04.html

You can still retrieve that page on the internet archive:

https://archive.org/index.php

I have occasionally casually looked for these again between 2008 and 2021, when I was doing surveys for other plants here, but never saw them again, probably because:

1.  I never brought even an approximate GPS point for them.

2.  I usually couldn't remember  the exact location.

3.  I was never again early enough in the year for them to be easily seen.","Riverside County, CA, USA",33.7741442613,-116.665466151,"","wild daffodil","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/108286947","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/182291645/medium.jpg","tchester",108286947,"Narcissus pseudonarcissus","Plantae",55848,0,0,"2008/06/20 6:39 PM PDT","2008-06-20","2008-06-21 01:39:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",20,20,"","","false","","",173818,"2022-03-10 06:09:35 UTC","2022-03-13 06:14:15 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

"Deconica montana","2008-06-03 00:00:00 +0000","<p>These were found and brought to me.  They were in among moss, and with the brown caps, and the lighter colored gills it was thought they might be Galerina.  I put them under the scope, and not so much.  They have short cheilocystidia which were pointed to subcapitate, no pleurocysitidia.  Which could be Galerina, but the spores gave it away.  They were non-dextrinoid, thick walled, smooth, smokey-brown in KOH with a clear germ pore.  Which makes these Psilocybe.  They were found near another collection of older P. montana.</p>
<p>7/31/2008 &#8211; Getting back to this, and adding some photos.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot here is of the gill edge, at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here some of the relatively short cheilocystidia can be seen, with some acute and some blunt ends.  Also the spores are non-dextrinoid</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the spores from the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  Here the spores are clearly thick-walled, smooth with blunt ends and a large germ pore.</p>

<p>As found in the mountains, with moss, and clearly Psilocybe, this makes these P. montana by the current accepted concept around here.  But Guzman makes a big deal in his monograph separating species by &#8220;subellipsoid&#8221; and &#8220;rhomboid&#8221; spores.  P. montana is supposed to be on the &#8220;rhomboid&#8221; branch, and these spores I&#8217;m not sure look &#8220;rhomboid&#8221;.</p>

"Catriona columbiana","2008-06-05 08:17:00 -0700","I found a <i>Flabellina</i> with some eggs down the wall of a pool immediately in front of me, so I stuck G9 in the pool, pointed it back toward the wall (and me), and tried to aim the camera, shooting blind.  After a few shots I got a mediocre one with the slug in frame.  What I didn't notice until I got home that one of my &quot;bad&quot; shots contained this <em>other</em> creature, which I believe to be a nudibranch, and certainly not another <i>F. trilineata</i>.  

I suspect that this is <a href=""http://www.seaslugforum.net/factsheet.cfm?base=catrcolu""><i>Catriona columbiana</i></a>, due to the dense, dark cerata that eventually become white at the tips.  If you use your imagination, there is a hint of orange toward the head that might be part of the orange rhinophores and feeding tentacles.  Behrens &amp; Hermosillo (2005) also say they feed on the hydroid <i>Tubularia</i>, and this thing is definitely headed straight for a hydroid that might very well be <i>Tubularia</i>.  The slug was at least 1 cm long, if not longer, observed at Bean Hollow State Beach, Pescadero, CA, USA.  

Can anyone confirm the ID or offer alternatives?  I've done nothing to the image other than crop it and change the white balance to auto, because it was shot in underwater mode, which shifts colors toward the reds to compensate for red filtering at depth, and this was only in a tidepool.

The sensation of finding a potentially interesting creature in a photo that you didn't intend to take is odd.  Cool because it's new, frustrating because I didn't actually see it.  Sort of like the flipside of seeing something awesome and then realizing your batteries just died.","Pescadero, California, United States",37.2264137268,-122.411491394,"","British Columbia Aeolid","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/1132","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/1158/medium.jpg","kueda",1132,"British Columbia Aeolid","Mollusca",48973,2,0,"June 05, 2008 08:17","2008-06-05","2008-06-05 15:17:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,NA,"","false",NA,NA,1,"2009-01-01 15:42:56 UTC","2021-10-22 02:37:12 UTC","research","CC0",NA,NA,"false"
