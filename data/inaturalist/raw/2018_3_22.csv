"Encelia farinosa × californica","2018-03-22 15:01:57 -0700","The flowers are in clusters and the peduncles are yellowish like E. farinosa. The leaves are greener and scattered along the stem like E. californica. This is one of a cluster of Encelia plants just inside the railing at an entrance to Mission Trails Regional Park. There are numerous Encelia farinosa plants along the road here that I believe were planted in the 1970s when the sidewalks were put in. There are also many Encelia californica plants along the trails that radiate out from this entrance.

Flowers are in axillary and terminal racemes; pink with dark red tips; upper petal is spurred. Leaves are alternate, pinnate or 2-pinnate with ultimate segments deeply lobed. Fruit is ovoid to almost round; surface is smooth (when fresh). 

Flowers per inflorescence: 11 

Measurements: I didn't take samples for measurements from this site since there were only 2 flowers. See the following observation, which was about 0.25 miles down the same trail and had a much larger population of F. muralis:

"Galium aparine","2018-03-22 16:40:54 -0700","This specimen was found in a medical office landscape bed.  The stems were about 14"" with shorter and longer stems on other plants nearby.  The stems are square with hard edges, the side of which are generously covered with downward pointing tiny stiff hairs that catch surfaces, allowing stems to creep out and up and over other stems, plants and surfaces from the tap root. 
Leaves are whorled (6-8 leaves in a whorl), and also covered with downward pointing hairs. Whorls are well spaced on the stems. Very small, four-part, white flowers form on the tips of short branches that start from the junction of leaf and stem.

Calflora considers this particular species a CA native.

"Lysimachia arvensis","2018-03-22 16:42:21 -0700","Specimen found in untended medical office landscape bed. Plant was about 12"" tall and was typical of those in the immediate area. Stems are square.
 
Flowers were not fully open and may have closed because the weather was cloudy and it had recently rained. They were a peachy orange or salmon color.  5-petals that overlap at the base. Flower are on slender stalks, and grow singly between the stem and leaf stalks.

Leaves are well-spaced on the stem, opposite and stalkless. 
They take an oval shape - wider at the stem attachment end and pointed at the tip. Leaves have a hairy underside with dark spots.

I originally learned this plant/flower as ""poor man's weather glass"" - so named because of the opening and closing of the flowers.

Not easy to see in photos but has blotchy appearance in addition to iridescent yellowish spots. Once it warmed in my wet hand, it began to climb up my torso with agility. Openned and closed mouth repeatedly as it began to climb. (Possible defensive posture.)
