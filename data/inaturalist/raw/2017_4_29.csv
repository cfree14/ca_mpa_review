By midafternoon it had fallen off the rock it was on, turned upside-down covered in sand and flies started flying into its mouth. Still no mother. Surprisingly the Bodega Bay Marine lab wouldn't allow Marine Rescue to assist even though the pup was obviously in distress and easily accessible. Marine Rescue was called, had someone available in the area, and a volunteer who works at the lab, but were denied access even as the vultures flew in to wait on a nearby rock. A shame actually, and hard to watch it suffer. Couldn't understand the Marine Lab's stance when it is also a wildlife sanctuary.

There were 2 larger lizards in the oregano and so I didn't release him there.  This one was in the track of the sliding patio door.
Tuesday after this observation, too late, a little lizard was seen in the same door track that had been moved.  He backed up further under the door.  I don't know if he made it out or died under there.
A different little lizard with a tail regenerating and bent at the tip, was close to the sliding door, outside, found under the dogs water bowl, twice.
Counting the one removed from the garage, that makes 4 (at least one repeat) inside very recently.  The weather is warm and the grass is wet with dew in the morning.  There is a shallow dish of water in the garden, away from the house.
