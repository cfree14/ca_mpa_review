"Cortinarius cotoneus","2006-01-07 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Here is an observation of this one from Jan 2006, the only time I have seen this one.  It keyed out with Arora, but there he calls this C. cotoneus group, so only a rough guess at species here.  This is a little different than the observation 396, since the stipe is not white, and the stipe also shows scaling that that observation doesn&#8217;t seem to.</p>
<p>This one was found under coastal live oak.</p>
<p>Also I remember a week later at the Santa Cruz Fungus Fair, one of these was brought in for display.</p>
<p>But I didn&#8217;t see one of these this year in the searching, and sorry, I don&#8217;t have any dried material.  But I thought I would add the observation.</p>
<p>If Dr. Ammirati at University of Washington has any further hints about understanding Corts, I would love to read up on some more refs.  Arora does a good job at simplifying, but adds lots of comments about 100 similar species, or 400 closely related species&#8230; that doesn&#8217;t give one much confidence in an id.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60648851","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/96992796/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60648851,"Cortinarius cotoneus","Fungi",518760,0,0,"2006-01-07","2006-01-07","","UTC",703,703,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 21:03:43 UTC","2020-09-24 21:03:46 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

"Sus scrofa","2006-01-18 12:30:00 -0500","Introduced invasive pigs, although (success!) these animals no longer occur on the island.  Kiwis were there while I was there, trying to eradicate them.  They were <a href=""http://travel.latimes.com/articles/la-trw-feral-pigs-eradicated-from-santa-cruz-island-30aug07"">successful</a> just six months later.  The last feral pig was destroyed on July 5, 2006, and the native flora is reportedly on the rebound.  Here's a fun sounding article: <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709004935"">Rapid eradication of feral pigs (Sus scrofa) from Santa Cruz Island, California</a>

""In 411 days, a total of 5036 pigs were removed....Sterilized adult pigs fitted with radio collars were subsequently used to aid in the location of surviving wild pigs and to monitor the success of the project. Female telemetered pigs were more effective than males at locating remaining wild pigs. Only 10% of the last 102 pigs (the last 20 or so present in each fenced zone) were dispatched as a result of being found with a telemetered pig, but telemetered animals were responsible for finding 43% of the very last pigs once normal hunting had ceased.""
