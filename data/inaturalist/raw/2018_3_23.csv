"Phainopepla nitens","2018-03-23 13:57:16 -0700","A silky flycatcher with distinctive red eyes in bare tree in Palm Canyon. It’s name is from the Greek phain pepla meaning “shining robe” in reference to the male’s plumage.

Males are shiny black with prominent white wing patch visible in flight. Females and juveniles are overall gray-ish. Both have a conspicuous crest, long tail, and red eyes.

These birds are unusual in that they migrate both north and south and east and west, having two broods per year (if conditions are right).

In early spring they nest in Mesquite brushlands, feeding chiefly on insects and Mistletoe berries.
