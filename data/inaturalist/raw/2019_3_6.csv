"Frangula californica","2019-03-06 21:28:13 -0800","This seems to be a different form of Frangula californica. I used the Jepson Family key to resolve to Rhamnaceae, then the family key to resolve to Frangula. Fruit is a drupe, and an immature fruit seemed to have 2 capsules, although I should return to investigate when they are more ripe. The 5 sepals do indeed look fleshy and  keeled adaxially. So Genus Frangula. Now, using the key to Frangula, I checked twice,  and I seem to come up with Frangula californica subsp. californica. However, the leaves look more like subsp. ursina, but I can't find any hairs at all on the underside of the leaf. I think the leaves are evergreen, but this was found in northern Santa Barbara County by the coast. So, I could be wrong about couplet 8/8' but I really think the leaves seem like 8' because they are thick, not thin. So, that is F. californica. I will refrain from selecting a subspecies. Perhaps this is a woody, less red stemmed version, with different shaped leaves than I am used to seeing.
