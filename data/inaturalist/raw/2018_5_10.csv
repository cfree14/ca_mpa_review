"Myrmicinae","2018-05-10 23:34:03 -0700","I am so curious about these teeny ants. They appeared only a year or two ago. I have seen them since at another house about 3 miles away. They are maybe 1/4 the size of the black argentine ants we get everywhere. And only about 2 feet away from a busy argentine ant trail. But the two don’t seem to interact. These little guys don’t seem to do anything at all except build tiny ant hills in the driveway. In spite of our encouraging them they have never grown in numbers particularly. No idea what they eat.

Note that there are ants in these photos. You may have to zoom in to see them. Maybe six or eight in each shot.

"Pyrobombus","2018-05-10 07:59:00 -0700","This bumble bee was dead on the path. This was an opportunity to see the underside of the bee, which is rarely visible in life.

Cause of death is unknown.

Probably Bombus vosnesenskii, but could be B. caliginosus. These two species can rarely be differentiated by photo and need microscopic analysis for reliable identification.
