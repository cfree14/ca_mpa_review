"Pica","2017-04-08 00:00:00 -0800","Crow sized bird flew over my head with a moving jumble of stark black & white markings, landed in tree overhead, then flew off. In photo head not visible, but white markings on tail, wing, & under body. I've never seen a Magpie, but this is the only bird that fits what I saw. Somewhat out of it's range. 

This is the only shot I got.  Click on photo, then on ""original"" to zoom in.

More detailed writing,  Jan 25, 2020:
I was standing in my yard, looking at birds in this tree, my little digital camera in hand, when suddenly, from directly behind me, a black & white, broken chess game, the size of a crow, zoomed a few feet over my head. It swooped upward, landing inelegantly in the Eucalyptus, nearly overshooting the branch, as a circus clown or drunk person might. The Mockingbird and House Finches in the tree quickly scattered in different directions. There was already a lot of bird noise, like laughter in the air, so I can't say if it made any particular sounds. It never stopped changing positions on the branch as I snapped this photo. Its remarkably long, black tail is partly obscured by vegetation in this pic, and appears shorter than it was. While I zoomed the lens for a better view, the bird took off, flying in the direction it had come from. It was  in the tree about 15 seconds. I had never seen one of these before, so while it may not be a Magpie, I continue to insist it was not a Mockingbird.","Division St, Los Angeles 90065",34.11384,-118.222555,"","True Magpies","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/5654785","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/7000629/medium.jpeg","crayonsss",5654785,"Typical Magpies","Aves",8318,0,3,"2017-04-08","2017-04-08","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",30,30,"","open","false","","",164021,"2017-04-12 00:43:47 UTC","2020-01-26 00:56:18 UTC","casual","CC-BY-NC","",NA,"false"
