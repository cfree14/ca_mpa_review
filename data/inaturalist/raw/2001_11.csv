"Puma concolor","2001-11-10 00:00:00 -0700","These photos are from a 20 minute video from an encounter i had back in November 2001... I was tracking a bear and saw this Mountain Lion approaching from my right, low to the ground... took my typical two steps forward indicating I'm not going forward or back ward, establishing my space separate of her space (works well with bears and other wildlife too). After climbing on a 6 -7 foot granite rock, she eventually lied down and we hung out for a fascinating and peaceful 20 minutes.

Added the estimated date of November 10, 2001.

Below are the two part edited and summarized videos of this wonderful encounter.

Still have original full 20 minute encounter on video.
When she is licking her mouth, she is picking up my chemical cues and distributing them on the roof of her mouth... using her Vomeronasal Organ to detect my mood and how comfortable I am, my intentions, and identify my chemical signature... I had spent a lot of time/years  in this area, and continued to be able to do so through the years... tracking, observing, and interacting with the bears and other wildlife.

My alma mater, UNR and a former long time biology professor and researcher who was the director of this remote research area, allowed me to visit this area under lock and key... He found my interactions with, and observations of the bears of this area to be interesting.

And including when I first started hiking up from a park I worked at in the valley below in the mid/late 1980's, and the senior project I conducted on bears as Seed Dispersal Agents in my last year at UNR, spent over 3 decades visiting bears here and becoming part of the neighborhood... living among the bears here on several occasions. Had relationships with some bears for 8 to 15 years. It was a wonderful experience... and along with the coyotes, some big and small cats got to know me too.
