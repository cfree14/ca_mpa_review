Red stems indicate this species locally. If you gently push down the bottom (fused wing) petal, you can expose the keel petal, which has different degrees of hairiness on the upper and lower surfaces.

An illustration of the keel being exposed from the wing petals can be seen here:

site survey by PSRF volunteer M. Anders, Saturday Morning, May 19, 2018.

Crown Beach Memorial Park, Alameda, San Francisco Bay California.

Summary:

Crown Memorial Beach; Crown beach and Park St. and Westline and Shoreline, East Bay(Alameda Ca); local resident and PSRF site monitor M Anders have continued to document and map depositions of dead fish and bat rays on their routine surveys of this apparent hotspot for strandings this season.

More dead bat rays and the usual allotment of dead striped bass (evidence suggests pathogen not result of low salinity and in keeping with stagnant and polluted water and runoff contamination, further work up of the fish are pending as study now will focus also on fin fish such as halibut and striped bass in addition to sharks, skates and rays.

Overall, strandings have greatly diminished from level and scope of strandings during the 2016 and 2017 seasons despite increased unit of effort at known hotspots in mostly San Mateo (slow for strandings thus far, so far so good) and Alameda.

The Alameda area strandings are very consistent and appear to be drifting and depositing there in the area around Crown Beach Memorial Park, it is not known where the die off is occurring and appears that most of the stranded specimens located are washing ashore with the currents and tides and are typically a few days old by the time they are beaching near Crown Beach.

PSRF volunteer and site monitor in Patrice Frazier San Mateo, reports no news of strandings in the areas she peruses in San Mateo but is on the sharp look out. Meanwhile as a volunteer staffer with bay area Marine Science Institute this season, she noted that on most recent survey by MSI they did collect and release a good number of bat rays and some leopard sharks including at least one large apparently healthy leopard shark in the 5' length range which is atypical and noteworthy. Previous surveys showed relatively fewer sharks and rays than is typical however most recent survey was encouraging.

A local resident of Redwood City Jonathon D is an avid bicyclist and first PSRF volunteer keeping a sharp eye along the bay trails and urban lagoons within Redwood City, including the Oracle complex which experienced a serious die off event during 2018 within its inland waterways. So far nothing noteworthy seen in those areas since monitoring began in April. He has noted remnants of some well dead sharks (at least 4) that were not noted or reported, nothing fresh or recent and estimated to be 2-3 weeks dead.

No reports thus year for Oakland or Berkeley however we are currently looking into that area in keeping with last two years site surveying schedules and recent news yesterday regarding a dead whale in Oakland, possibly resulting from vessel strike and investigations ongoing via Marine Mammal Center and cetacean specialists and shipping authorities.

We are seeking additional volunteers from local bay area regions to assist in sustaining unit of effort and increased survey range. Learn more via email: psrf@pelagic.org

There are still large areas of the bay area that are relatively remote and unmonitored and out of the way (South Bay and North Bay), the public is advised and requested to take photos and note location of any sightings of dead, dying or apparently distressed sharks, skates, rays of fishes and alternatively any good documentation of sharks, rays and other marine fish type wildlife that may be encountered.

Overall the number and frequency of strandings has diminished since 2018. Although there are apparent identified hotspots involving ongoing smaller scale die offs, 2018 has so far shown fewest strandings since 2015. 2016, 2017 were far more severe and on similar scale as the earlier 2011 mass die offs.

Please report any sightings of dead, distressed sharks, skates, rays or fish to help our ongoing long term monitoring study and investigation into mass epizootic die offs and chronic strandings in San Francisco Bay and the Central California Coast.

Stranding hotline is 831 459 9346. Thank you volunteers.

"Euphorbia segetalis","2018-05-19 14:43:53 -0700","BJ Stacey @finatic recently discovered this largish group of Euphorbia sp.which prompted me to check out what may be going on, and his can be seen here:
https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/12257377

I observed numerous individual shoots both in the planted area and on the other side of the park fence (seen on the 6th and 7th photos of this observation), which leads down to a riparian area.  I feel it is clear some individuals, including the one in this observation, were planted on site, while others have propagated on their own.  I did not check for rhizomes on this visit, if they are involved.  It is probably true that all of the shoots are still within the area that benefits from irrigation, but a ready, more natural, water source is but 15-20 yards away for the plants to establish into.

A handful of other shootsfrom this location can be seen in the below observations:
