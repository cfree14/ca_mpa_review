Hi, Ken-ichi.  Tech help pls!

Remedial question: do I need to persuade iNat to cough up the taxon as a lookup result (does clicking on it do something magical), or -- assuming I've double-checked the accepted name & its spelling -- can I resort to just saving free text?

- When I enter Lotus strigosus & click Lookup, & search ext providers, I don't get the sp, just 3 ssp. 
- If I manually search uBio, I do get the sp (tho it doesn't seem to know it's a plant).
- The hits screen claims there's no Wikipedia article associated with the taxon, but if I click on the taxon, there's a perfectly good Wiki article at the bottom of the taxon screen.
- The taxon screen shows me 2 Flickr cc images (1 of which is gorgeous, the other of which is mine), & prompts me to add an icon.  [Ah, so that's how my raven image ended up as the raven icon! That was a nice surprise.]  The gorgeous one would be perfect, & I have confirmed that it is cc licensed,  but when I try, it can't find any Flickr photos from within the add-icon dialog.

Thanks!

Unrelated question: is there any way to see recent ID activity on my photos from within iNat?  I can click on the email alerts, but can't seem to get to them any other way.
