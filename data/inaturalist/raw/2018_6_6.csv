I‚Äôm going to try to keep it until it turns into a moth so I can see what it is.  Hopefully it fares better than the looper caterpillar that turned out to be full of wasp eggs.  
*Update: the last two pictures are the same caterpillar a day later after eating geranium flowers and buds.  It didn‚Äôt eat the hibiscus petal that was in the jar, so I‚Äôm not sure where the yellow color came from.  Maybe from the yellowing buds on the geranium plant.
