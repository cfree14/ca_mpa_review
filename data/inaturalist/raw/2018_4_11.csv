"Pheucticus melanocephalus","2018-04-11 17:45:46 -0700","I know that this picture is basically useless by itself, but I’d love any help with this bird. It was in the hopper feeder picking up seeds in its beak (although I’m not 100% sure that it was eating them). It had a yellow head and belly with grey/brown wings, noticeable white wing bars and eyebrow. 

Some time after it left, I heard the familiar “wheet wheet” calls of a hooded oriole and saw something of similar color flying overhead. I’m used to seeing orioles, but I’ve never seen a grosbeak in my life, let alone in my yard. 

Is it more likely that this was an oriole eating/playing with seed, or a grosbeak?
