"Pheucticus melanocephalus × ludovicianus","2012-12-23 08:09:00 -0800","23 December 2012. Montecito, Santa Barbara County, California. The general consensus seems to be that this bird may not be identifiable or may be a hybrid Rose-breasted x Black-headed. Characters that are odd include the very buffy breast, mostly dark maxilla, and brown (rather than dark brown) auriculars and lateral crown stripes, but with black streaks going most of the way across the chest.

Notes from September 2017: I just went through a large series if specimens of Pheucticus grosbeaks and at present I think that this is a Rose-breasted Grosbeak. It could be a hybrid, but I'm not seeing many characters that couldn't also be within the range of variation of pure Rose-breasted. The streaking on the flanks and chest is far too thick for any Black-headed, and there is considerable variation in the extent of streaking on the center of the chest in Rose-breasted. Maxilla color is also variable in Rose-breasted, with some females showing some dark. When Rose-breasted shows buff on the chest it is concentrated on the upper chest as in this bird, whereas a Black-headed has the buff or orangish extending from the chest all the ways down to the lower flanks, often contrasting with some yellow on the center of the belly even in the dullest females. 
I would expect a hybrid to show thinner streaks, not just fewer streaks, though of course a hybrid can't be eliminated entirely.

There is a county easement at the back of our yard between our block and the next which I think increases chances of wildlife. We get tons of birds, butterflies, these lizards, caterpillars, and occasional possums and raccoons, even a coyote recently.

""The first two are of a salamander we often find when planting, moving pots, etc. These were taken Dec. 23, 2012, at 1:30 in the afternoon. Partly cloudy day.

""I'm also including a photo of our yard for reference (though it is much more lush now with vegetables, natives, and fruit trees).""

A huge pine cone next to it was much longer than my hand (close to 15 inches or 40 cm, based on the photo). I need to work with iNat and Picasa to get it to load.

Though there were no other pines nearby, it's possible the cone came from a different individual or species upslope. I think only the Sugar Pine has cones that long.

Far more skittish and shy than any of the other ducks here, the Goldeneye has been eluding me ever since I started spotting him out of the corner of my eye earlier this week. At first I thought he might've been an extra shy female bufflehead, due to the similar head markings, but yesterday we made eye contact and I got a view of the brilliant gold before he hurriedly paddled off around the corner of the building.

I snapped a few shots with my iPhone later in the afternoon when I spied him again near the bridge.","Big Rock Ranch, Nicasio, CA",38.0525350493,-122.6280748844,"big rock duck goldeneye common winter","Common Goldeneye","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/158922","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/216144/medium.png","billyverde",158922,"Common Goldeneye","Aves",6990,2,0,"2012-12-06","2012-12-06","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","open","false","","",7448,"2012-12-07 21:40:02 UTC","2016-06-22 22:16:14 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
