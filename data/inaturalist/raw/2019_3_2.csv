""One thing we notice on our 1/4 mile driveway, is when we move the newts off the road, they often turn around and go back on the road. I think they like eating the earthworms that come out on the road (because they are drowning in the rain) and are easily visible.

Saturday: I found this little guy on the side of the road. It's eyes were open and it looked alive, so I picked it up and put it in the grass. Notice the tail - it's split. I continued the roadkill survey and returned about 15 minutes later - it hadn't moved. I'm not sure it will survive.

2019-03-06 (Wed): I found this little guy dead about 3 inches from where I left him on Saturday.

This will be a good subject for the decomposition rate study since it's not on the road now and so it won't be run over by numerous cars.

*** Decomposition Rate Study *** 
These observations show the decomposition of a newt over time. This will give us a sense of how fast the bodies decompose so that duplicate entries aren't added to the main project and the total count is more accurate.

My wife swears that this is Agaricus hondensis.  I found some while driving north of Petaluma years ago.  We both handled them. She had a swollen face within a few hours (not rash/blistering like poison oak). I was fine.  She freaks out on hondensis and xanthodermis to this day. 

I think it's an A. hondensis too.

It's large and has orange hairs at the tip of its stipe and cream colored spores, but its stipe is hollow like L. rubidus (not just the pinhole hollow that is common in L. rufulus), and most strongly it smells like fresh rubidus. Also, relative to its larger size its substance seems more rubidus. Rufulus would feel chunkier, more dense, and heavier for its size. To me this seems 50/50 rufulus/rubidus.
