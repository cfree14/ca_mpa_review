"Homalocephala polycephala polycephala","2010-12-17 12:47:00 -0800","Mike Crouse discovered this plant right next to the Villager Peak Trail, which I had either not-noticed, or mistaken as a Ferocactus, on two previous trips!  This plant had bloomed earlier this year.

It was a perfect Echinocactus:

 - it has woolly fruit, near the tip of the barrel, and not the glabrous fruit, in a ring somewhat below the tip, of Ferocactus;

 - the number of ribs are 16, 18, and 19, not the 21 to 29 for Ferocactus;

 - the areoles have all stout spines, with the bristle-like non-rubst lower spines for Ferocactus.

As far as I know, this is the westernmost location for this species in the Borrego Valley area.
Alas, eight years later at least two of the ~7 barrels were dead:

And three years after that, 11 years after this first observation, it was complete dead or close to it.  See:

Q avg. = 1.5</p>
<p>Given that a spore population of this size yielded us a 1.5 Q value, I think this has a good chance at being <a href=""http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/lookup_name/Antrodiella+breckonii""><i>A. breckonii</i></a>. What Noah&#8217;s observation <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> mention is that I found this fruiting under <a href=""http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/lookup_name/Pinus+radiata""><i>Pinus radiata</i></a> AT <span class=""caps"">SFSU</span> (ie, the type locality!). <br />
I will work on sequencing my collection, and will get in contact with Rod and Dennis Desjardin about sequencing the type collection.</p>
<p>If they turn out to be close enough genetically, we should deposit this new collection (NS 15Dec2010-3) as Representative Specimens.</p>

http://mojavedesert.net/plants/shrubs/juniper.html

But I can't find a description of such cones in any floras. All say the ""seed cones"" are fleshy blue berries and the ""pollen cones"" are tiny.

When I'm convinced said bird is not our quarry, I notice a county cop car behind me, flashing its lights, no siren.  I pull over, and two officers get out, flank us, and procede to ask, in a friendly fashion, what we're doing driving so slowly out in the middle of nowhere.  They also point out that two young men in a car of Asian make looks suspicious in this part of the country, where apparently pairs of young men in Asian cars often prospect for promising places to grow weed.  We patiently explain that while we find plants of all kinds quite intriguing, we are not at this moment surveying for spots to grow that particular plant, and are, in fact, searching for a pink and green woodpecker.  Bemused, and perhaps even a little concerned, the officers advise us on the best places to spot elk (warning us not to shoot any), and even recommend a novel describing the kind of crime that occurs in this part of the country (the title of which I have sadly forgotten).
