<p>Just to add some numbers, the caps are 1.8-2 cm, and stipe is 2.5 cm long and 3-4 mm wide.</p>
<p>Ok, after being unknown for a few weeks, finally have an answer on this one.  I was able to confer with Dr. Else Vellinga of Berkeley, at the SF group/Oakland Museum fungus fair this last weekend (12/3/2006).  And she took away the dried material and photos, and got back to me.</p>
<p>This is L. neophana, and the ref. for the species is Sundburg, W.J., Mycotaxon 34: 239-248, and can be found here:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/index.htm"">http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/index.htm</a></p>
<p>And the specific ref. for this species is:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0034/001/0245.htm"">http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/...</a></p>
<p>Which looks pretty good, and was found before in San Mateo Co.</p>
<p>Else said she is going to keep this material for the herbarium in Berkeley.</p>
<p>She also mentioned that L. neophana was first sited from the midwest, but after looking at more meterial it is probably true that the easter neophana is a different species than the western one found here.  Esp. since the eastern species is supposed to be a lighter color, and not break up into scales like this one.</p>

Your picture of Lepiota seminuda in fact is a species in the L. sequioarum complex.  Cystolepiota seminuda is small (caps up to half an inch, more or less), with a rounded cap and a fine granulose covering, which in young fruitbodies hangs down the cap margin in triangular teeth. The stipe is thin, also finely powdery, with a wine-red tinge to it under the cover.  A ring is not really present, there may be traces left on the stipe where the cap broke off from the stipe Your specimen here is bigger, with a flatter cap, radially fibrillose silky, with a prominent ring on the stipe (and lots of microscopic characters which also distinguish it from C. seminuda).  Unfortunately, what has been called L. sequoiarum here is in fact a complex of 5 or 6 different species. I&#8217;m in the midst of figuring it all out.<br />

"Sympetrum illotum","2006-11-01 13:09:00 -0800","I previously submitted this as a Cardinal MH. Author and authority Kathy Biggs disagreed, noting the blackish legs and suggesting it was a Red-veined. I attempted to respond via an edit but got into a mess with lined-out ID’s and incorrect “ID withdrawn” messages, so I’m reposting it with a more detailed comment and support, viz: 

This is a Cardinal, the blackish-looking legs notwithstanding. For one thing, Red-veineds around here have a short flight season. They’re abundant at all our higher-elevation ponds from early June ’til late July and then they disappear; by Nov 1, the date of this shot, they’re long gone. This one is lit up from behind making the venation look all red, but those are the stubbier, broader wings and the lighter pterostigmae of a Cardinal.

PS: Dear Ms Biggs: Thank you for your book.* A little story: My parents were active birders for 60 years; when they couldn’t get out any more I would send them what we called “odopix.” They enjoyed using your book to identify my shots -- they called it their “odobook” and it lived next to their iMac.
