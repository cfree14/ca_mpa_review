Super fun encounter. Saw this lizard posing impressively by the side of the fire road and stopped to observe. As I stood very still, the lizard approached me, eventually hopping onto my boot and then scrambling up my leg. 

Eventually, after we'd taken some photos and the lizard kept climbing higher, I decided it was time to encourage it to climb down. I moved my leg a little, but the lizard only climbed higher. I moved my water bottle slowly toward it and eventually the lizard climbed down and hopped off. Still didn't run away, though!
