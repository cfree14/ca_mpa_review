"Linum bienne","2018-05-06 12:38:00 -0700","Pale Flax (Linum bienne), photographed along the Edgewood Trail near the Highway 280 overpass at Edgewood Road in San Mateo County, CA.  Identified as Pale Flax based on the following characteristics (per Jepson's eFlora):

1) Specimen in photograph has open, bisexual flowers.
2) Each flower contains a single pistil.
3) Perianth consists of a whorl of 5 sepals, subtending a whorl of 5 petals.
4) Petals free (at least at the base) and falling singly.
5) Leaf simple, sometimes much reduced.
6) Flower's ovary superior (obvious from this photo).
7) Plant an herb, forb, or subshrub. (<--- Gets me to Jepson's Group 24).
8) Flowers radial in symmetry; plants green and photosynthetic.
9) # of stamens  = # of petals = 5. (The stamens are the blue-tipped structures near the center of the flower.  In this flower, the have adhered to the central pistil.)
10) Leaves alternate; leaf linear and entire.
11) Leaves cauline; flowers solitary. (<---- Gets me to the family Linaceae.)
12) # of styles = # of stigmas = 5.  [<--- Gets me to the genus Linum.] (Unfortunately, the separate styles and stigmas are not possible to see in this picture, because they are obscured by the stamens.  However, if we discount the 5 styles and 5 stigmas, then the only alternatives wihtin the family Linaceae are the genera Hesperolinon and Sclerolinon, whose flowers come in varying shades of yellow, white, pink, and purple, but not blue.  Therefore, by process of elimination, we are still left with the genus Linum, as it is the ily one that contains species with blue flowers.)
13) Petals blue to white; margins of inner sepals entire.
14) Stigmas elongate, linear to club-shaped; plant is an annual, weak perennial herb, or biennial.
15) Petals 6â10 mm; fruit generally 4â6 mm wide.  (No fruit were available for study at the time this photograph was taken, in early May.) [<---- Gets me to Linum bienne.]
