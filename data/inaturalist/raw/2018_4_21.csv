Also a good match for tail shape. From what I could gather, this is the only species of chipmunk in the county. However, this is on the edge or outside of the range on most maps. The only place that I've personally seen chipmunks in the county was at high elevations on Pine Flat Road. Long-tailed weasel was my other thought. This doesn't look quite right for that though.

It seems very unlikely that someone would deliberately plant something that has the potential to become (essentially) a tree directly underneath a chainlink fence.  Not only could it damage the fence, it could take up space needed for vehicles (it's a rental vehicle lot).  For these reasons, I think it is wild.  Sort of moot at this point anyway because they've removed the plant since I made this observation.

"Sambucus cerulea","2018-04-21 12:31:00 -0700","Blue Elderberry (Sambucus nigra ssp. caerulea), photographed along the Coyote Creek Trail in Milpitas, CA, not far from the northern parking area for the trail along McCarthy Boulevard.  Included with this observation  is a set of three photographs:

1) The lead shot shows the inflorescence for this small tree.  The inflorescence is panicle of cymes of small, cream-colored flowers, with each flower consisting of 5 spreading petals, 5 stamens, and a single pistil (which are difficult to see at this level of magnification).  The inflorescence as a whole is relatively flat-topped, so the flowers in the top plane of the inflorescence are all in focus.  The flat-topped infloresence and the spreading petals of its flowers are key field marks, distinguishing the Blue Elderberry from its close cousin, the Red Elderberry (Sambucus racemosa). (The inflorescence of the Red Elderberry is more mound or dome-shaped, and the petals of its flowers are often reflexed,.)

2)  Shot 2 shows the pinnately compound leaves of this tree.  Mature leaves typically consist of 9 leaflets, which in this case are elliptical in shape, with toothed margins and no hairs on either the upper or lower surfaces.  These leaves are large - typically around 9 inches long, with each leaflet being between 4 and 5 inches long.

3) The third and last shot of the set shows the tree in situ.  Blue Elderberry trees are not especially large; this one seems to be on the order of about 5m tall.  (It has the darker colored trunk.  The tree that it is leaning against, with the pale gray trunk, is an alder.)

Note:  At the time that these photographs were taken (mid-April), the flowers had just opened, so there were no fruit available for study or pictures.","Coyote Creek Trail, Milpitas, CA",37.4470318139,-121.9229087234,"Blue Elderberry, Coyote Creek Trail, Milpitas, Rank 2, Sambucus nigra ssp. caerulea, Santa Clara County","blue elder","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/11353395","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/16175095/medium.jpg","arnel",11353395,"blue elder","Plantae",143799,1,0,"2018/04/21 12:31 PM PDT","2018-04-21","2018-04-21 19:31:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",4,4,"","","false","","",29323,"2018-04-23 04:27:49 UTC","2018-05-18 11:19:53 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

"Orgyia vetusta","2018-04-21 14:26:00 -0700","A Western Tussock Moth Caterpillar (Orgyia vetusta), photographed as it was crawling up the exterior wall of the bathrooms at Washington Park in Sunnyvale, CA.  This has been a banner season for caterpillars of the Western Tussock Moth, who appear to have taken over many of the urban parks in the area.  The infestation has been so pronounced this year that it has even made the local news, who obligingly posted pictures of this critter along with its identification.  This made identifying the little beast fairly straightforward.

Despite its bristliness and hairiness, the caterpillar of the Western Tussock is actually a very colorful creature.  One can find every color of the rainbow amongst its hairs and bristles except for green and violet.   Its colorfulness may indicate that it isn't especially tasty to would-be predators, but I'm not absolutely sure about that.  It can get to a respectable size for a caterpillar; I think this one was about 1.3 inches long.
