"Eschscholzia californica","2018-06-04 15:23:35 -0700","Found in the Sandhills of the San Lorenzo Valley, Santa Cruz County. Sandhills poppies (Eschscholzia californica) have small, yellow flowers and colorful pigments in the leaves, whereas more widespread populations of our state flower typically have green foliage and orange flowers. Research has shown that the traits of the Sandhills poppy have a genetic basis, and do not simply result from growth in the unique environmental conditions. These traits may be important adaptations for life in the Sandhills. For example, Sandhills insects may preferentially visit yellow flowers, so orange flowers might not be pollinated. Occasionally poppies with intermediate flower and foliage characteristics are observed in the Sandhills, suggesting that the genetic material of more widespread poppies is being introduced into the Sandhills, perhaps from nearby developments where they are commonly planted. This introduction of non-Sandhills poppy genes could disrupt the locally adapted gene complexes and alter the course of evolution of Sandhills poppies as a unique species.","8690 Glen Arbor Rd, Ben Lomond, CA, US",37.0781138333,-122.0784916667,"","California poppy","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/13125991","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/38892719/medium.jpg","nonawill",13125991,"California poppy","Plantae",48225,1,0,"Mon Jun 04 2018 15:23:35 GMT-0700 (PDT)","2018-06-04","2018-06-04 22:23:35 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",5,5,"","","false","","",766944,"2018-06-04 22:37:50 UTC","2021-06-09 00:23:38 UTC","research","",NA,3,"false"

Such a beautiful moth! Drawn (accidentally) to an outdoor light; still there in the morning.

Looks most likely to be A. proxima or A. nevadensis.
