"Eucalyptus","2019-03-07 08:47:48 -0800","Some kind of eucalyptus tree. The leaves are oily and smell very strongly when crushed in my hand. They also seem to stay somewhat ovate and do not get ‘long and skinny’ like many species of eucalyptus. The bark around the trunk is scaly and thick but, younger branches have the typical ‘papery’ eucalyptus bark that is whitish/gray and peels off in big sheets, exposing bright green bark beneath it. I will continue to add more pics throughout the year, as the tree goes through it cycles.

"Lupinus nanus","2019-03-07 17:05:16 -0800","Odor: sweet, like candy.

This L. nanus patch on my street is back again, and others down the road, I'm sure. I keyed it out last year, so I know what it is.

I will return for more photos. I would like to post photos of all the parts of the flower, and the stem base, including with a metric ruler.

L. nanus forms fields around here, and smells delightful. L. bicolor, located on the next corner over, is diminutive, and has no odor that I can detect.

Environment is basically coastal,  stabilized dunes, not far from open dunes, residential neighborhood, Nipomo Mesa.

Mediterranean climate, and good rainfall so far this year for this area, it seems. California in general is getting a decent amount of rain.

The Lupinus bicolor on this dry, sandy soil corner of the Nipomo Mesa, barely out of the dunes, on residential, basically stabilized dune habitat. L. nanus 1/2 block away. There was rain today, however.

This diminutive Lupine has an  inflorescence head that is only about 15mm diameter as viewed from above. I will return with a better scale.

The banner petal tapers up, and is longer than wide. I observed this patch of Lupine last year, and took photographs of the flower parts,  and with a metric ruler. I didn't post that yet, I don't think.

"Mimus polyglottos","2019-03-07 14:12:26 -0800","EDIT: after more research into the call of this bird, I am very confident in my identification :)

I am new to birding, so I am not 100% confident on this identification. (Or maybe even 90%) The only thing keeping me from more confidently saying it was a northern mockingbird is that it didnt have quite so many markings on its upper wings.

I was able to get a good long look and a couple videos of the bird, and I noted:
-thin, slightly hooked black bill 
-pale, creamy colored brown/grey chest and underbelly
-musical, continuously changing call (the bird did not stop singing until it flew away)
-long tail
-dark back and tail with possible white edge
-long thin legs","1180 Jean Ave, Porterville, CA, US",36.0871111667,-119.043625,NA,"Northern Mockingbird","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/21034035","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/32492145/medium.jpg","ickymicky",21034035,"Northern Mockingbird","Aves",14886,1,0,"Thu Mar 07 2019 14:12:26 GMT-0800 (PST)","2019-03-07","2019-03-07 22:12:26 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",7,7,"","open","false","","",1312389,"2019-03-07 22:29:40 UTC","2019-04-28 02:06:10 UTC","research","",NA,3,"false"
