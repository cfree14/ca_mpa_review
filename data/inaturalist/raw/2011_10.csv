"Pterygoplichthys","2011-10-07 08:19:33 -0700","Sorry these pictures are not very detailed. But this was a fish that I found on a path beside the Los Angeles river. The river in this area is just a cement trough. At the time, in October 2011, there was a ton of silt debris and small plants growing. Some one, I suppose the city of Los Angeles, came and dredged everything out. This fish was in part of the dredging remains. I was surprised to see a fish because normally there‚Äôs such a low trickle of water that I assumed it was pretty sparse of marine life. Any ideas of what this species is? It looks to be some kind of catfish.","Valleyheart Dr, Los Angeles, CA, US",34.1489762665,-118.421717523,"","Sailfin Catfishes","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/67806042","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/109648451/medium.jpg","russomon",67806042,"Sailfin Catfishes","Actinopterygii",91566,3,0,"Fri Oct 07 2011 08:19:33 GMT-0700 (PDT)","2011-10-07","2011-10-07 15:19:33 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",115,115,"","","false","","",3941217,"2021-01-09 18:37:28 UTC","2021-01-09 22:12:19 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,3,"false"

But these seem to be more like L. pseudomucidus.  Although when I see that species on the coast, it is always soooo viscid, it is hard to hold in your hand, sliding right out of your grip.  Also in those it seems like stipe is more consistently grey, where here it is slightly grey and mostly off-white.  But I dried these, and maybe I&#8217;ll look at the spores one day, and if the spores turn out to better match L. pseudomucidus, I&#8217;ll just go with that id.

"Xanthoteras teres","2011-10-01 18:53:00 -0700","I thought this gall was on the underside of a Quercus berberidifolia leaf.  However, Ron Russo's Field Guide to Plant Galls indicates that this species is found on Oregon and leather oak.  I no longer remember the exact location on the trail where I found this specimen, so I can't go back to check for sure, but it's clearly not Oregon oak, and the leaf doesn't appear to be convex or hairy enough to be leather oak. I realize that all three are in the white oak group, but it seems strange that Q. berberidifolia would be omitted from the description. So am I incorrect about my identification (of the gall or the host plant), did I find an anomaly, or is the text incomplete? Comments/explanations will be greatly appreciated.

"Clathrus ruber","2011-10-16 00:00:00 -0800","(Mushroom Expert.com)

by Michael Kuo

If there were such a thing as an orange ""Wiffle football,"" it would be Clathrus ruber. You wouldn't want to hike it to a friend, however, since its interior surfaces are coated with a foul-smelling slime that attracts flies and other insects (who then disperse the mushroom's spores). Like other stinkhorns, it arises from an ""egg"" that is attached to the ground with long cords.

Officially a European species, Clathrus ruber is found with some regularity in northern California. A similar species, Clathrus crispus, appears in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. I suspect that reports of Clathrus ruber from southeastern North America represent Clathrus crispus.

My field guide and internet searching has narrowed this plant to this polypody. If I found it on the east coast it would be a Common Polypody. 

I have seen these plants in the Redwood forest living up in the trees on branches with lots of duff. 

The plant pictured I found in my front yard in an overgrown section that invasive plants I removed. This was from a larger group growing on a log. It fell off, I put it in the pot with bark and mulch, hung it in a tree next to my house and I has loved it there for years now.
