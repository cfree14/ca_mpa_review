"Hygrocybe","2009-01-31 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Ok, this isn&#8217;t much of an observation, but the recent New Zealand obs., and the recent discussions of the unknown Mycena Observation #4649, reminded me of this one.</p>
<p>This is a tiny bright colored little guy, brought in by James Edmonds at the last BAMS ACCF, at Albion, CA.  It was only about 3-4mm in diameter, and about 1.5-2cm long.  Didn&#8217;t know much what to do with it, bright, and slightly waxy maybe, so we kinda put a name of Hygrocybe sp. on it.  I took a photo, as I try to do, and later just put a number on it, and popped it in the drier.  But since it was soo small, also all by itself, just didn&#8217;t know what to do about it, and mostly forgot about it.</p>
<p>But looking over the New Zealand and other Tropical observations (Ecuador maybe?), I keep seeing something like this, as perhaps a bright red Mycena.</p>
<p>But not sure, in the end don&#8217;t know.  Haven&#8217;t seem much else like this little guy in California before or since.  But thought I would toss it up here, as another possible tropical California siting, and see what people thought (or not)&#8230;</p>","Albion, Mendocino Co., California, USA",39.22805,-123.758,"","Waxcaps","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60683442","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97052715/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60683442,"Waxcaps","Fungi",51871,1,0,"2009-01-31","2009-01-31","","UTC",2230,2230,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-25 04:18:46 UTC","2020-09-25 16:43:55 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

This was the first time for these to be added to the species list, no one worried about the little brown guys before it seems.  With the new wood chips on the landscaping there were quite common this weekend.</p>
<p>Adding some micro-details:</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the cap surface at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The cap surface is cellular, without pileocystidia, or gelatin.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The cheilocystidia are lageniform to fusiod-ventricose, with acute ends.  Also 4-spored basidia, no pleurocystidia, and no reactions to the reagent.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of the stipe apex at 400x in KOH.  The caulocystidia are similar to the cheilocystidia, with intermixed globose elements.  No cystidia obs. at the stipe base, also clamp con. obs.</p>
<p>The forth micro-shot is of spores from stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  Spores are ellipsoid, smooth, with a germ pore.  Ave spore size : length &#8211; 9.95 +/- 0.32 (err 0.11) um, width &#8211; 5.46 +/- 0.13 um (err: 0.07) &#8211; q : 1.82 +/- 0.06, on 11 spores.</p>

"Hygrophorus camarophyllus","2009-01-24 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Was kinda excited to see these.  There are these two deep grey Hygrophorus sited in Largent&#8217;s Hygrophorus of CA, and each of them were listed from only one sample found.  One is the H. marzuolus, which is usually found in the spring up in the Sierras.  I&#8217;ve seen a few of these, and have a few dried samples.  Then we also lists H. camarophyllus, from the caost in the fall.  I&#8217;ve heard tell of these in the past, this is the first time I was able to get a photo and a dried sample.</p>
<p>One thing though, the H. marzoulus is a European name, and H. camarophyllus is from the east coast.  I&#8217;m not sure either of these is really one of those.  I&#8217;ve seen photos of H. marzoulus, and what we see is awfully like that.  I&#8217;ve also seen photos of the east coast H. camarophyllus, and they really don&#8217;t look like these.</p>
<p>So, not sure here.  The CA samples could be two different species, or the same, and they could be different from the east coast and Europe, or the same.  I guess to &#8220;prove&#8221; it would take finding a distinct character to separate them, and examining the type specimens.

<p>Subgenus Cyanula, Section Caesicaules, Series Caesicaules; near the <br />
<em>subviduense</em> complex.</p>
<p>Collected 31 Jan 2009, Mendocino County, California, <span class=""caps"">USA</span></p>
<p><b>Cap</b>: 31.6 mm wide, 13.8 mm high.  Appressed-fibrillose, broadly convex, margin slightly inrolled and wavy.  Deep midnight blue-black.  Small umbo (papillate).  Flesh 1.6 mm thick at disc.  Dingy-white flesh.  <br />
<b>Lamellae</b>: 12-16 mm long, 4.2-7 mm deep. Pallid creamy-tan or flesh-colored, quite blue-gray near the stipe, somewhat marginate along the inner 1/2 of some of the larger lamellae.  Approximately equal depths.  Mostly straight to slightly wavy.  <br />
<b>Stipe</b>: 58.7 mm tall.  3.7 mm thick at apex, 3.6 mm thick at lowest point. Medium blue-gray, quite a bit lighter than cap. Glabrous except for distinct scurfs at apex. Striate at base, with distinct mycelial bulb at base &#8211; 7.6 mm thick.  <br />
<b>Odor</b>: (After 2 days of storage in a tacklebox) &#8211; faintly fragrant-pungent or indistinct.<br />
<b>Spores</b>: (10-13.5) 12.1 μm x 6.9 (5.7-7.7) μm, 5-6 sided, heterodiametric.<br />
<b>Pileipellis</b>: Trichodermium, entangled elements (collapsed ?) periclinal at disc, erect away from disc (this seems the opposite of the usual to me).<br />
<b>Stipitipellis</b>: With tufts of cylindrical-clavate caulocystidia.<br />
<b>Cheilocystidia</b>: Collapsed, not abundant, cylindrical-clavate to subcapitate.<br />
<b>Pleurocystidia</b>: Scattered, cyclindrico-clavate, approximately 25 μm tall.<br />
<b>Clamp connections</b>: Absent in all tissues examined (pilepellis, lamellae, stipe, mycelium at base of stipe)</p>
<p>These species can be eliminated by AT <span class=""caps"">LEAST</span> the indicated characteristic (and usually many others):<br />
<em>parva</em>: different pilepellis and pileus color<br />
<em>yatesii</em>: decurrent lamellae<br />
<em>viridiflavipes</em>: color of stipe base, clustered habit<br />
<em>chalybea</em>: basal mycelium scarce to absent, stipe &#8220;perfectly&#8221; glabrous, pilepellis a palisade<br />
<em>decolorans</em> f. <em>atropruinosipes</em>: stipe covered in dark squamules<br />
<em>decolorans</em> f. <em>decolorans</em>: glabrous stipe<br />
<em>decolorans</em> f. <em>cystidiosa</em>: lacks pleurocystidia, different pilepellis</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/lookup_name/Leptonia+subviduense""><i>L. subviduense</i></a> group is close but the varieties differ at least in these characteristics:</p>
<p>var. <em>subviduense</em>: Lamellae most often with a decurrent tooth, rarely pruinose at apex, stipe quite fragile, smaller spores.<br />
var. <em>marginata</em>: Cheilocystidia abundant &#8211; originate as elements of pileal margin when young and thus identical to pileocystidia, gills serrulate, strongly marginate, stipe &#8220;extremely fragile&#8221;.</p>

"Eudendrium","2009-01-10 00:00:00 -0800","This is a hydroid in the genus <i>Eudendrium</i> that was quite abundant at Scott Creek last weekend.  I'd never seen it before, and yet there it was, large and in charge. Saw one with a <i>Hermissenda</i> chomping away (pics were awful), and this one was on the side of a boulder, maybe 10-15 cm tall.  John pointed it out as a &quot;Christmas Tree Hydroid,&quot; which seems like as good a name as any.  It's even ornamented!

Light's Manual lists <i>Eudendrium californicum</i> and <i>Eudendrium</i> spp., noting that there have been several species reported from the area that haven't been conclusively identified.  I don't see the heavy annulation that's supposed to be present on <i>E. californicum</i>, so I'll stick to the genus.  I mean, it's a hydroid.  I am <em>psyched</em> to have a genus.

Also, if, like me, you appreciate a good little bit of hilariously inscrutable technical writing, you will enjoy this utter gem from Light's:

<i>Species of this genus are characterized by typically styloid gonophores, trumpet-shaped hypostomes, and absense of desmonemes in the cnidome.</i>
