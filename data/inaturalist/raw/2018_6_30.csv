"Madia sativa","2018-06-30 11:27:00 -0700","Some Coast Tarweed (Madia sativa), photographed at Wavecrest Open Space in Half Moon Bay, CA.  This is a fairly tall species for the genus Madia, with not very showy flowers and lots of sticky, glandular hairs that have a strong, tar-like scent. Its croweded, spike-like inflorescence, relatively large flowers (with involucres generally greater than 10mm in diameter), and its lanceolate leaves distingusih it from the other tarweeds lacking showy flowers in the genus Madia that can be found in the San Francisco Bay Area (i.e., M. exigua, M. anomala, and M. gracilis).

Note:  This specis is also known as the Chile Tarweed, Chilean Tarweed, or Coast Madia.

Phellinus maybe?  Or pine bracket?  

The fungus lower on the wood may be a different species; I can’t tell.  (Maybe Trichaptum?)  Feel free to comment to suggest ID on the smaller lower one, and I will make a separate observation for it!  I haven’t because  the photo quality is so poor.

"Eugnatha","2018-06-30 07:42:00 -0700","Found by the front porch--maybe 2 1/2 inches long.  They are kind of cute this early in the morning.  They couple up--one on top of the other one's back, just sleeping.  Never seen them before--just suddenly saw them by the succulents near snail shells and decaying leaves under the shade of the bush.  They curl up easily and will climb walls at night.  Also, a pill bug was found next to them, but no interaction between the anthropoids.  As of July all five of the millipedes have disappeared--not doubt due to heat.  I'll miss them, but the pill bug is still there.

"Scrophularia californica","2018-06-30 13:01:00 -0700","California Figwort (Scrophularia caliornica), also known as California Bee Plant, photographed at Wavecrest Open Space in Half Moon Bay, CA.  There are four photos in the set of pictures documenting this specimen:

1) Shot 1 shows several a small grouping of California Figwort in situ, including the specimen documented here.  Note its erect habit and height; some of the individuals in this photograph are over 6 feet tall.
2) Shot 2 provides a closeup of the plant's leaves.  Note that the leaves are simple, triangular to lanceolate in overall shape, and heavily dentate on the margin.  
3) As these plants had mostly finished blooming, Shot 3 provides a close-up of their seed capsules in various states of maturity.  The seed capsules show that the original inflorescence was arranged as a panicle, with generally 3 to 10 flowers on each panicle branch. 
4) Shot 4 provides a close-up of two remaining flowers. Note that each of these flowers consist of a highly inflated, reddish corolla tube with an aperture that has a two-lobed upper lip, a single-lobed lower lip, and a single-lobed ""wing"" to either side.  The upper lip is much larger than the lower lip, with the two wings in between the upper and lower lips in size.  Included inside the corolla tube are two fertile stamens, an infertile staminode, and a pistil (which is often not visible from the aperture).  The two stamens and one staminode can be seen in the apertures of both of the remaining flowers.  The flowers of Scrophularia californica are apparently irresistable to bees, which is why one of this plant's common names is the California Bee Plant.

Known as Nuttall's White-crowned Sparrow (Z. leucophrus nuttalli), this subspecies is characterized by a bright yellow-orange bill, warm brown coloring on the wings, grayish brown coloring on the back with little to no patterning, and a relatively dingy, grayish-white breast.  This individual is showing some signs of feather wear, especially on its back feathers, which is not unusual for this time of the year.","Wavecrest Open Space, Half Moon Bay, CA",37.4456141647,-122.4378060669,"Half Moon Bay, Nuttall's White-crowned Sparrow, Rank 2, San Mateo County, Wavecrest Open Space, White-crowned Sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys, Zonotrichia leucophrys nuttalli","Nuttall's White-crowned Sparrow","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/13944504","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/20609072/medium.jpg","arnel",13944504,"Nuttall's White-crowned Sparrow","Aves",244380,1,0,"2018/06/30 10:37 AM PDT","2018-06-30","2018-06-30 17:37:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",2,2,"","open","false","","",29323,"2018-07-01 13:45:20 UTC","2018-07-01 14:47:13 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
