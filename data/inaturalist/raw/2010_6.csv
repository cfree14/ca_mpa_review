"Conocybe","2010-06-07 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Found under three-needle pine, and black oak, in the duff.  At about 3800 ft. elevation.</p>
<p>These are a weird one. quite a good collection of these was found, about 2 dozen bodies.  These are bright lime-green when young, and become tan-yellow as they age.  The caps are rugulose, at all ages, and never striate.  Not sure, but they don&#8217;t appear hygrophanous, but that is hard to tell with the color changes, and rough surface.</p>
<p>We put these under the scope quickly, and confirmed that they are Conocybe.  We were able to see much in the way of caulocystidia though.  What we did see what very small and randomly shaped, about only 10um long.  Although from the photos it looks like caulocystidia have to be there.</p>
<p>Mike Wood mentioned that ones like these were also obs. the week before from the Yosemite valley.  But he couldn&#8217;t find any photos of them, and I don&#8217;t see any records of them in the Yosemite collections that have been listed so far.</p>
<p>With the distinctive features of these, they really look like a strange new species of Conocybe.</p>
<p>7/20/2010 &#8211; Getting back to adding some micro-details.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The lecythiform cheilocystidia are obvious, and this is clearly a Conocybe.  Also along with this no pleurocystidia were obs., the basidia were 4-spored, also separated by spacer cells, and no reactions to Meltzer&#8217;s were obs. anywhere (spores or tissues).</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is on a section of cap surface at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The cap sruface here is curious, not quite clearly cellular as you would expect.  It is a randomize surface of inflated and filiform hyphae, more of less lying down on the surface.  I would expect the clear hymeniform surface for Conocybe, but this one is weird.  Not clearly cellular or not.  No surface gelatin was obs.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of the stipe surface near the apex at 400x in KOH.  Here you can a clump of caulocystidia.  There are multiple kinds of cystidia there, some clavate, some lageniform and wavy, and many long filiform.</p>
<p>The forth micro-shot is of some spores from the stipe surface at 1000x in KOH.  Here the spores are smooth, ellipsoid, brown and with a germ pore.  They are quite large, roughly 18 um long.</p>
<p>With this they seem to be at least in the section Candidae of Conocybe, which makes them related to the Conocybe apala variations.  But these seem to clearly be a new undescribed species.

<p>The first micro-shot is of asci at 1000x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The asci&#8217;s here are 8-spored, and no reaction to Meltzer&#8217;s.  The spores are ellipsoid, smooth, lacking oil drops, roughly 7 &#215; 3 um.  The asci&#8217;s here are rather short, only 55-70 um long.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of back of the ascocarp at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  These are the &#8220;hairs&#8221;, the stiff black hyphae on the back and around the edges of the &#8220;cup&#8221;.  They are multi-septate, darkly pigmented and ornamented with warts.</p>
<p>Comparing this to notes in the &#8220;Champignons du Suisse&#8221;, tome 1, Breitenbach, it matches well with the description of Lachnellula arida there.</p>
<p>I wanted to check this out under the scope, since id&#8217;s of these tiny hairy cups seem to always be put to question.  This one matches what was expected, given the experience of the Spring Fungi of the Sierras course over the years.</p>","Yosemite National Park, California, USA",37.84,-119.5405,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60682859","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97051846/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60682859,"Lachnellula arida","Fungi",499637,2,0,"2010-06-05","2010-06-05","","UTC",48882,48882,"","","false",NA,NA,734334,"2020-09-25 04:08:35 UTC","2020-11-09 23:33:07 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC-ND","",NA,"false"

<p>Brown spores, veil fragments on margin, some with brown ring high up on stipe.</p>
<p>7/22/2010 &#8211; adding some micro-details to the obs.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the cap surface in radial section at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here the cap surface is clearly a cutis.  There is only a light amount of gelatin between the hyphae, not greatly viscid.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  There are cheilocystidia on a non-fertile edge, the cystidia are lageniform with thick bases and blunt to acute apecies.  Also no pleurocystidia were obs., and the basidia are 4-spored.  There were no reactions to Meltzer&#8217;s in the spores or gill tissues.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of the stipe surface near the apex at 400x in KOH.  Caulocystidia are obs. in tight clusters, clavate to thickly cylidrical.  No caulocystidia were obs. near the base.</p>
<p>The fourth micro-shot is of spores from the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  The spores are ellipsoid, smooth, tan, somewhat thick-walled with a germ pore.  The rough size of spores are 7 &#215; 4 um.</p>
<p>The identity here was fairly clear, but I wanted to get down and post a set of complete micro-details as part of this, to be used in comparison in the future.</p>","Yosemite National Park, California, USA",37.84,-119.5405,"","conifer woodtuft","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60682854","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97051817/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60682854,"Kuehneromyces lignicola","Fungi",495391,1,0,"2010-06-05","2010-06-05","","UTC",48882,48882,"","","false",NA,NA,734334,"2020-09-25 04:08:16 UTC","2020-09-25 16:45:59 UTC","research","","",NA,"false"

<p>I&#8217;ve gone through Helvellas I&#8217;ve seen, and I&#8217;m not sure this matched any of those.  Not sure which Helvella these are.</p>
<p>7/20/2010 &#8211; adding some micro-details.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of fertile surface at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The ascis are 8-spored, and clear, with no reactions to the Meltzer&#8217;s.  The spores are smooth, ellipsoid, with one large oil drop.  The rough spore size is 17 &#215; 12 um.  The paraphyses are hyaline, and lightly clavate, thickening to the ends, with blunt rounded ends.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the tissue on the back side at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  This just shows the multi-cell &#8220;hairs&#8221; on the back of the &#8220;cap&#8221; surface, such that the back side is fibrous, and not glaborous.</p>
<p>Put this together, with the white more or less smooth stipe, and the light grey tones of the fertile surface, this seems to best match Helvella latispora, which is the preferred name of H. stevensii.  The paper notes that this is known from the west, although it only really mentions Idaho, and is known to fruit in the spring-summer.  Arora mentions H. stevensii as having a more wide-spread distribution.  Also this species is keyed out from Mushroomexpert.com.  I tried to check on what the North West Key Council might have to say about this, and I didn&#8217;t get any response from their web server.  I might check that at another time, but this id seem fairly good.</p>","Yosemite National Park, California, USA",37.84,-119.5405,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60682798","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97051734/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60682798,"Helvella latispora","Fungi",1261751,0,0,"2010-06-05","2010-06-05","","UTC",48882,48882,"","","false",NA,NA,734334,"2020-09-25 04:07:21 UTC","2021-07-05 17:36:21 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC-ND","",NA,"false"

<p>With a slight raphanoid odor.  Light fibrous partial veil obs., with brown spore deposit.  Veil disappears on many.</p>
<p>This is what people have been calling Hebeloma mesophaeum in the western US, but who knows if it is really or not.</p>
<p>7/20/2010 &#8211; adding some micro-details</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here the cheilocystidia are numerous on a non-fertile edge.  They are mostly cylindrical, some bent, some with a slight thickened base, all with blunt even ends.  No pleurocystidia were obs.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of spores from the gill at 1000x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The spores are ellipsoid and beaned shaped, lightly roughen surface (hard to see in a photo), rounded ends, and no reaction to Meltzer&#8217;s.  Roughly 8.5 um long.</p>
<p>Putting this together, this agrees pretty well with H. mesophaeum, so I wasn&#8217;t bad with the id.  This is described fairly well in &#8220;Veiled Hebeloma of Western US&#8221; Smith, Evenson, Mitchel (1983).

<p>7/20/2010 &#8211; adding some micro-details.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of spores taken from the gleba, at 1000x mounted in KOH.  The spores are brown, ellipsoid, warted, with a beak at the apiculus.  The rough size of the spores are 9.5 &#215; 6.5 um.  Along with the spore a number of basidia were also obs.</p>
<p>So, with this Mike obtained the id from the paper &#8220;Notes of the species of Hymernogaster&#8221; A. H. Smith, Mycologia 58, p100-124 (1966).  Actually the id from the paper was for Hymenogaster brunescense, but this has been synonymized with Hymenogaster sublilacinus from a more recent study.</p>
<p>With spores like this, this is closely related to Cortinarius, and perhaps should be put into that genus.</p>","Pinecrest, California, USA",38.17875,-120.014,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60682695","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97051510/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60682695,"Cortinarius lilacinoides","Fungi",1151995,1,0,"2010-06-04","2010-06-04","","UTC",2366,2366,"","","false",NA,NA,734334,"2020-09-25 04:04:32 UTC","2021-01-09 04:25:26 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC-ND","",NA,"false"
