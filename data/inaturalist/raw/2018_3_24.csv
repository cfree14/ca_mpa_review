"Tamarix aphylla","2018-03-24 09:34:00 -0700","Tamarisk are Introduced water hogs in the desert landscape. They were planted to provide shade and more importantly windbreaks. They also provide habitat for owls and other large birds that need to roost in large trees. It’s a very controversial tree. . .

Saltcedar flowers appear more purple and are found in a wide range elevations, from high to low.

"Lunularia cruciata","2018-03-24 14:28:00 -0700","This liverwort has smallish, slightly ruffled leaf structures (thalli).  Thalli are a glossy yellowish-green and appear to be dotted.  The dots are framed with 5-sided borders. 

Many leaves show the characteristic crescent shaped cups.  A few in the photos still contain gemmae, tiny clones of the plant that are washed into the soil by rain. We have had several days of sometimes heavy rain and this is a relatively unprotected spot which might be why there are so few gemmae visible.
