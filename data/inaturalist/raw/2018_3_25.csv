Which makes sense because it's been eating pollinators, I guess.

"Petrochelidon pyrrhonota","2018-03-25 12:35:00 -0700","I was actually shooting this small group of Northern Shovelers (Spatula clypeata) near the Stevens Creek Tidal Marsh in Mountain View, CA, when one of the local swallows zipped past them and inadvertently became part of this picture.  What's noticeable about this swallow is the extensive whitish coloration on its rump.  For the area, only one species has a large, whitish rump patch like this - the Cliff Swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota), which does actually nest in moderately large numbers nearby. Given the time of year when this photo was taken (late March), this is likely a returning adult. 

Adult Cliff Swallows also have a small, white patch on the forehead and a pale collar that wraps around the nape.  However, these field marks are not as prominent as the rump patch, and would probably not be visible at the distance from which this photograph was taken, the speed at which the bird was flying, and the weak sunlight in which the bird was photographed.  Also, the bird's white underparts would not be visible at the angle with which it is being viewed here.  What should be visible is the dark head, face, back, and wings, along with that bright, whitish rump patch.  

This Cliff Swallow was actually one of many swallows actively hunting in this canal when this photograph was taken.  A heavy northwesterly wind was blowing across the canal, causing insects to be trapped in air currents and eddies just above the surface of the water in the canal.  Flying low over the canal from the south, the swallows could then pluck these insects out of the air, or - on occasion - pluck out a hapless insect from the water's surface.
