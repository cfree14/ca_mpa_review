"Arbutus menziesii","2018-05-29 00:00:00 +0000","I'm not sure if this is a juvenile madrone or manzanita. 

""Manzanitas, in the genus Arctostaphylos, are very common around here, while the single local species of Madrone, Arbutus arizonica, is quite rare.

I wanted a quick rule of thumb for distinguishing madrones from manzanitas. The trunk bark is one clue, as madrones have rough oak-like bark while manzanitas have trunks with the same orange-brown bark exhibited on the branches of both manzanitas and madrones.

This evening I came up with a mnemonic which I think will be a help. The leaves of the madrones grow in opposite pairs; the name “madrone” has an “o” in it, which stands for “opposite”.

This hawk let me get within 5 feet of him and was not bothered what so ever. He had a sore foot so I'm not sure if that may have been the reason of not but I stood there with him for over 10 min before he took off out over the hills of the canyon. This was such and an awesome encounter that I will be writing a journal entry about the whole thing with a lot more detail.
