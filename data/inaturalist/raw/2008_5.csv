"Crepidotus pallidoluteus","2008-05-31 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Found by Debbie Veiss &#8211; same as obs. #7681.</p>
<p>Got this under the scope, and here are some notes:</p>
<p>Cap surface a trichoderm of filamentous interwoven hyphae, on a pileus trama of interwoven inflated hyphae.  Cheilocystidia observed, long filamentous, numerous, some branched.  Pleurocystidia not observed except for some near the gill edge.  Mostly 4-spored basidia with some 3-spored.  Spores thick walled, ellipsoid, inamyloid, non-dextrinoid and lightly warted.  Clamp connections observed.</p>
<p>Looking at the NA monograph on Crepidotis by Hessler and Smith, this gets you down close to C. fibriatus, which is what is often seen at the Spring Fungi of Sierras course, and was id&#8217;ed as such in the past years.  But it is also close to C. pallidoluteus, and in the comments for C. fibriatus it says that C. pallidoluteus is similar but the pileus is more yellow and the margin is non-fibrate.  It also mentions that the margin is inrolled in C. fibriatus in not in C. pallidoluteus.</p>
<p>Dr. Desjardin commented that these look to be a different species than C. fibriatus, and with the details and comments in the monograph, it does look like these are a better match for C. pallidoluteus.</p>
<p>The monograph mentions that this species was observed in Montana July-August, so not sure how far off this is.</p>
<p>6/24/2008 &#8211; Getting back to adding some photos here, micro-shots from looking under the scope.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of a gill edge in Meltzer&#8217;s at 400&#215;.  Here you can see the long filamentous cheilocystidia.  The cystidia were seen along the edge, as you can see not solid cystidia, but in between basidia.  There were no pleurocystidia seen, except near to the gill edge.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the cap surface at 400x, at least at the layer where the pileus trama ends, and the pileipellis hyphae start.  The hyphae of the surface are long and thin, and grow from the pileus trama straight up and interweave.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of some of the surface filamentous hyphae, at 400&#215;.  Here if you look carefully you can see clear clamp connections at each septa.</p>
<p>The forth micro-shot is of spores at 1000&#215;.  Unfortunately here I can&#8217;t get mature spores from the stipe apex, there is no stipe.  I didn&#8217;t see much from the cap surface, so these are probably spores from the gill.  In any case, you can mostly see the light warted surface, which was hard to get in focus for a photo.  It could only really be seen moving the focus in and out, but it kinda comes through here in this shot.</p>","Eastern Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Siskiyou Co., California, USA",41.2742,-122.056,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60659924","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97010619/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60659924,"Crepidotus pallidoluteus","Fungi",1134090,1,0,"2008-05-31","2008-05-31","","UTC",52939,52939,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 22:55:31 UTC","2021-04-20 04:14:39 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC-ND",NA,NA,"false"

2008 was one of the wettest springs in decades in this area, which is what it takes to bring out the mariposas in full glory.  Though long known from the southeast margin of the White Mountains, this species was unfortunately overlooked and omitted from the Intermountain Flora series, along with another brilliantly flowered species, scarlet loco (Astragalus coccineus).  Rare omissions from one of the best floras ever published.

Also visible in this diverse mixed-shrub vegetation are Cooper goldenbush (Ericameria cooperi), Nevada Mormon tea (Ephedra nevadensis), hopsage (Grayia spinosa), cottonthorn (Tetradymia axillaris), budsage (Artemisia spinescens), boxthorn (Lycium andersonii), desert paintbrush (Castilleja chromosa), galleta grass (Hilaria jamesii), and more.

This is a recently discovered northward range extension (or maybe more accurately, remnant of range contraction) for this species at the southern edge of the Great Basin in the White Mountains.  Only this single very healthy plant was found despite multiple further searches of the area.  The main range of chaparral yucca is in the southern Sierra Nevada and southwestern California chaparral, into northern Baja California.

Specimen number Morefield 5818.

		   Right
	All of the above whales are Baleen whales and thus are candidates for the fossilized rib bone found at Sunset Beach, Point Reyes National Park, (Summer, 2002).  According to Doug Long at the California Academy of Sciences, you would need a piece of the skull to determine which family.
	These bones originate in the Purisima Formation which runs from just north of Pt. Reyes south to Santa Cruz and Aptos. This formation dates from seven to nine million years before present. Considering that formation is on the west side of the San Andreas Fault and fault movement averages two inches a year, this whale died somewhere near the present location of San Luis Obispo.
