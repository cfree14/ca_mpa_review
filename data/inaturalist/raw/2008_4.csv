"Hygrophorus","2008-04-24 00:00:00 +0000","<p>These were found by Herman Brown and sent to me for scope work.</p>
<p>In discussions on the BAMS (www.bayareamushrooms.org) mailing list, there were a number of spring fungi found by Herman Brown from the Greenville, CA area.  One of these was a grey fleshy hygrophorus, and there was a discussion about it being either H. marzuolus or H. camarophyllus.  I had seen grey guys id&#8217;ed from the Yuba pass area in the spring before, and the difference I was told in the id at the time was that H. marzuolus smells like mouse cages, and H. camarophyllus is only fungal smelling.</p>
<p>Dimi went on to point out that H. marzuolus is a European species really, rare in the US, and the lit. from Europe doesn&#8217;t mention the mouse cage odor.</p>
<p>So, as a weird guy, I thought I would just add some micro-details and create at least one &#8220;good&#8221; observation of this thing, to build on here.  Herman went back up the hill, and got another one, and dried it and sent it to me, and I put it under the scope.</p>
<p>The &#8216;shroom is shown in the first two shots, by Herman Brown.  It is grey, fleshy, whitish to off-white stipe and gills.  The cap is kinda viscid, and he tells me there was no odor of mouse cage, only a shroomy odor.  Dried it didn&#8217;t smell like anything.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of a gill section in Congo Red at 100&#215;.  This displays the divergent gill trama which is particular to many species of the Hygrophorus section of the genus Hygrophorus.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the basidia attached to the gill trama at 400x in Congo Red.  Here the basidia are shown to be long and thin, along with the divergent trama, this is def. now a Hygrophorus.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of the cap surface in radial section at 400x in water.  The pileipellis is an ixocutis, with radially aligned hyphae in a gelatin layer.  This is a fairly thin layer, on a hypodermium of interwoven hyphae.</p>
<p>The forth micro-shot is of the basidia with some spores attached at 1000x in congo red.  Here this shows a 4-spored basidia, with spores attached to long sterigmata.</p>
<p>So, now what to do with this.  Using three sources, (1) &#8220;Spring Mushrooms of the Sierras&#8221; D. Desjardin, (2) &#8220;Hygrophorus of CA&#8221; D. Largent, and (3) &#8220;N. American Hygrophorus&#8221; L. R. Hessler and A. H. Smith, I get &#8211; nowhere&#8230;</p>
<p>Looking at features, noting the sources:</p>
<p>No mousy odor (1): H. camarophyllus<br />
Viscid cap (1,2,3): H. marzuolus<br />
Hypodermium of interwoven &#8220;puzzle-like&#8221; hyphae (2): H. camarophyllus<br />
Long sterigmata (2): H. marzuolus</p>
<p>Largent actually goes on to say that H. camarophyllus lacks any sterigmata (I&#8217;m not sure how a basidia produces spores without this, but I can&#8217;t find another species of Hygrophorus that I have a sample of, with the same claim, I was hoping to compare.).  Hessler and Smith state that the hypodermium is of radial aligned hyphae, not the &#8220;puzzle-like&#8221; hyphae that Largent notes.</p>
<p>One thing, is that the whole thing between these species comes from very few samples.  Largent bases the whole thing on one each, and A. H. Smith kinda started with whole thing, by finding one in a snow bank in Idaho, and calling that one H. marzuolus, and its gone on from there.  H. camarophyllus seems to be a fairly common grey guy from the east, but uncertain how rare from here.  Largent makes a note of the odor, and that note I believe has been used over the years for the Spring fungi class.</p>
<p>So, there it is, one found, and here are some observations, and toss a coin, it is 50-50 from features, one or the other.  To keep going, it would be good to get someone to observe and post some H. camarophyllus from back east.  And anyone that want to add some European sources to compare to this observation feel free.</p>","Greenville, California, USA",40.1403,-120.9345,"","Woodwaxes","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60659712","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97010134/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60659712,"Hygrophorus","Fungi",63108,0,0,"2008-04-24","2008-04-24","","UTC",6578,6578,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 22:52:46 UTC","2020-09-24 22:52:54 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"
"Panaeolus foenisecii","2008-04-02 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Found these recently and thought I would get down some details on these since there was some recent discussion on these.</p>
<p>I found these in an irrigated lawn, where over the course of the first week of April here, a bunch kept coming up.  The first photo here is of the caps, which look pretty much clearly like P. foenisecii (I hope).</p>
<p>The second photo here is of the spore print.  Which is pretty dark, and I would say pretty much black.  If this is brown, is a bit of brown mixed in with the black.  The color in the photo here came out pretty well just like the print itself.</p>
<p>The third photo here is of some spores from the stipe apex in KOH at 1000&#215;.  They are a dark brown, as a black spore print would be expected.  The spores clearly have a germ pore, and are warted, making this from the section Panaeolina in Psathyrella, or genus Panaeolina or Panaeolus depending on how you want to list these.</p>
<p>The fourth photo is the cap surface in radial section at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  I include this here to point out the spherical inflated cells on the cap surface, and how they are a few cells deep, pushing through each other upwards.</p>","Mountain View, California, USA",37.3935,-122.087,"","Mower's Mushroom","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60659372","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97009505/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60659372,"Panaeolus foenisecii","Fungi",902551,0,0,"2008-04-02","2008-04-02","","UTC",5064,5064,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 22:48:52 UTC","2020-09-24 22:48:59 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

"Uta stansburiana elegans","2008-04-12 00:00:00 -0800","This one stumps me. Looks like a side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana), but it was 4 or 5 inches snout to vent -- about twice the size of any SBL I've ever seen. I know their coloration is highly variable, and there is a blotch on the side. This guy did appear about a month after a decent rainy season brought amazing wildflowers to this park. Wildflowers brought amazing caterpillars, then they brought all kinds of birds and beetles that eat caterpillars. Maybe it's a SBL who ate TONS of caterpillars and grew enormous, or maybe he has glandular issues. It was really lethargic (SBLs are usually really fast in the early afternoon when we saw him).Also makes me wonder if it was a transplant from somewhere else that wasn't digging our climate. We see all kinds of lizards here -- horny toads, fence, granite spiny, orange-throated whiptails, and California whiptails, but it's certainly none of those. I love a good mystery, but I'm highly curious.","Harford Springs Reserve",33.803985,-117.352011,"lizard","Western Side-blotched Lizard","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/3485301","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/4054100/medium.JPG","jen_iyer",3485301,"Western Side-blotched Lizard","Reptilia",36100,4,0,"2008-04-12","2008-04-12","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",13,13,"","open","false",NA,"",252870,"2016-06-20 00:23:48 UTC","2019-09-11 19:14:13 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

It begins going the opposite direction on the same road, on our way back to Arroyo Seco for a nocturnal spider hunt, with <a href=""http://nature.berkeley.edu/~jledford/"">Joel</a> jokingly chanting, &quot;C''mooooooon mountain lion!&quot;  While bustling with activity during the day, Arroyo Seco turned out to be almost bereft of life at night, but still, as we left, Joel chanted his chant, with undertones of dejection.  

Then, suddenly, a mountain lion jumped in front of the car.  A mountain lion.  Possibly blinded, it began trotting up the road, apparently oblivious to us as we followed.  As I wasted precious seconds pondering whether I could jump out of the moving car to get my camera out of the trunk, Joel pointed out this was an SUV and we could just reach back and grab it.  So <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/24554735@N06/"">April</a> heroically grabbed my camera, but it was stuck, so she heroically unstuck it and handed it up, and as I fumbled with the settings the lion slinked off at last.  

Elated but distraught, I clutched my camera in my lap for the rest of the drive, until we had returned to where we were staying.  Then we saw this wild pig.  I frantically snapped photos in a desparate play for redemption, but when I got them off the camera, I realized they were all at ISO 200.  200.  At night.  From a moving vehicle.  Without a flash.  So all I got from this night of big mammal madness was this, the bigfootest picture I've ever taken.
