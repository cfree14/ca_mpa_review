I assume this is a gerrid, but I am having some trouble keying it to genus in Polhemus and Chapman 1979.  Clearly has wings and a prominent median ridge on the venter.  Antennal segments 2 and 3 are a bit longer than antennal segment 1, but this is clearly too small for Limnoporus?","Packer Lake, California 96125, USA",39.6225165,-120.6555806,"CASENT 9096813","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/62222664","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/99665474/medium.jpg","kschnei",62222664,"Gerrini","Insecta",936827,1,0,"2008/07/09","2008-07-09","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",202,202,"","","false","","",16131,"2020-10-10 19:04:10 UTC","2020-10-10 19:40:59 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

<p>Not sure which one it is though&#8230;</p>
<p>8/02/2008 &#8211; getting back to this&#8230;</p>
<p>Got to looking at this one under the scope.  And it turns out to require quite a few microscopic detail to get to species.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The gill edge is non-fertile with crowded cheilocystidia, the shape is the classic Conocybe shape, and is called lecythiform.  Also the spores are non-dextrinoid.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is some of the cap surface at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  It kinda hard to see in this shot, esp. because the surface is a bit confused with tight cellular hyphae and pointed pileocystidia.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of the surface of the stipe near the apex at 400x in KOH.  Here can be seen a tight grouping of caulocystidia.  It turns out the caulocystidia are very taxonomically significant in Conocybe.  Here you can see wavy pointed cystidia, with long filiform cystidia, and there is no lecythiform cystidia.</p>
<p>The fourth micro-shot is of spores on the stipe surface near the apex at 1000x in KOH.  The spores are smooth, brown, with a germ pore.  Many seem to have a subhilar depression.  The rough ave. length appears to be near 16 um.</p>
<p>Also in other searches it was determined that the basidia are 2-spored, but I&#8217;ll spare you more micro-shots&#8230;</p>
<p>ANd it turns out you need to put together all this microscopic detail to get to species.  Using all this, and Flora Agaricina Neerlandica vol. 6, the species can be found fairly well to C. siliginea, which is common and cosmopolitan in Europe.</p>
<p>Adding another shot of two more cap found nearby, although are fairly beatup.  These show that this one darkens in age, to develop more brown tones.</p>","Mountain View, California, USA",37.3935,-122.087,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60661087","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97012583/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60661087,"Conocybe siliginea","Fungi",416259,0,0,"2008-07-21","2008-07-21","","UTC",5064,5064,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 23:08:31 UTC","2020-09-24 23:08:41 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

<p>8/02/2008 &#8211; getting back to these.</p>
<p>These are the common grass dwelling Conocybe, but I thought some micro-details recorded here would be nice for comparison.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  There were few cheilocystidia obs, but the ones seen were lecythiform (Conocybe-like).  The gill edges seemed a bit beat up in this one.  Either they were snail-munched, or it mentions that the gill deliquesce in age, and that might be starting.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the cap surface at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  There the surface can be seen to be cellular, and there are apear to be some pileocystidia, but not many.  I was trying to get a thin section here to have the surface in cross-section.  But it looked like the cap was only a few cells thick, so it would be very hard to get a thin enough section.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of the stipe surface at 400x in KOH.  Caulocystidia are seen here, and this is very important in determining Conocybe species.  Here there are pointed, and blunt cystidia, intermixed with long filiform cells.  This seems to be the almost unique character of this species.</p>
<p>The fourth micro-shot is of spores from the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  They are brown, ellipsoid, with a germ pore and smooth.</p>
<p>Also in other looking, there were 4-spored basidia, with a few 3-spored.</p>
<p>This all points to Conocybe albipes, which was Conocybe lactea.
