Posting photo and coordinates retroactively after recently learning this sighting may be near northeastern limit of previously recorded sightings in San Diego County.  Here is an extract from my contemporary log from that date:

... telltale buzz ignited ahead of me just a couple of yards off the trail.  What a surprise to see a Red Diamond Rattlesnake way up here on this rocky ground.  This fellow was about 3 feet long, much smaller and more slender than the giant Red Diamond I met up with near the Sweetwater Bridge last week.  This one did a similar cobra-like body lift to gain height to check me out and to show me he was there.  His tongue was really getting a workout as it tried to figure out what I might be.  After a few minutes in this position, during which time I was able to get out my camera and capture a few portraits, he started angling slightly toward me, head up all the time, before deciding I must be benign.   At this point, he angled off and retreated to the shadows and protection of a nearby Ocotillo and cholla.","Open slope above Box Canyon NW of Coyote Canyon/Creek",33.395,-116.432,"Red Diamond Rattlesnake, Crotalus ruber","Red Diamond Rattlesnake","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/2671860","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/3002831/medium.jpg","donendicott",2671860,"Red Diamond Rattlesnake","Reptilia",30724,6,0,"2004-03-27","2004-03-27","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false",NA,"",47563,"2016-02-12 05:23:59 UTC","2021-11-05 12:44:15 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
