The presence of yellow hairs on the topmost abdominal segment (terga T1) eliminates the area's most common bumble bee - Bombus vosnesenskii - which always has black hairs across this part of its abdomen.  However, this opens the door to several other species, and exact identification would require a better view of the specimen, whose abdomen and face are partially concealed by the flowers that the bee is pollinating.
