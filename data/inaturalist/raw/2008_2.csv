<p>The third micro-shot here is of some spores from the stipe apex in KOH at 1000&#215;.  The spores are hyaline, smooth and subglobose.</p>
<p>So, not sure here, a white spored little brown job, with dark bumpy cells on the cap.  With the brown colors, and white amyloid spored this suggests Xerophilina, but I&#8217;m not sure.</p>

<p>The first shot is the &#8217;shrooms, they are about 2 cm tal, and caps are 5-8 mm in diameter.  The stipes are slightly bulbous at the base.

<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here there are cheilocystidia, which are lagentiform (finger-like), and numerous on a non-fertile edge.  The spores are clearly dextrinoid.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of some spores from the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  Here can be seen the main feature of species in this section of Galerina, that the spores have an exosporal covering that loosens at the plage, given the spores a skirted look.  Smith and Singer called these calyptrate spores, and put species with these into the section Calyptrata.  Also with species here you can see that the covering loosens at the apex in a few, given the spores a hooded look, but the calyptrate feature is the loosening at the plage area near the apiculus.

<p>A guy from Albion that I&#8217;m just getting under the scope.  At the time it was thought it looked like a Galerina, with a viscid cap, but we weren&#8217;t sure.</p>
<p>Under the scope, it&#8217;s a different story.  The first micro-shot is of the gill edge in Meltzer&#8217;s at 400&#215;.  There is no cystidia on the gills in this one.  The spores are actually non-dextrinoid, although they look at little red in mass in this shot.  They are dark brown, thick-walled, in mass this seems to give the shot a red-tone.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the cap surface in radial section, at 400x in meltzers.  Here the pileipellis is a nice clear ixo-cutis, with a good thick layer of gelatin.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of spores from the stipe apex in KOH, at 1000&#215;.  Here the spores are smooth, smokey brown, and have a clear germ pore.  The spores also seem to have a fat midsection, in one profile, and slim in another profile.  I forget the tech. terms for that.</p>
<p>Being little brown jobs, pointed caps, nice thick ixocutis surface, this could all be Galerina.  But lacking cheilocystidia, and esp. the smooth dark spores with a germ pore, this isn&#8217;t Galerina.  I&#8217;m not exactly sure what that makes it, but probably a Psilocybe?</p>","Albion, Mendocino Co., California, USA",39.22805,-123.758,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60658725","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97008568/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60658725,"Deconica phyllogena","Fungi",1094852,0,0,"2008-02-02","2008-02-02","","UTC",2230,2230,"","","false",NA,"",734334,"2020-09-24 22:42:36 UTC","2020-09-24 22:42:43 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

<p>Ok, here&#8217;s one, I can&#8217;t get the genus on.  It was found at Albion, in a camp ground on the north side of Jackson St. Dem. Forest.  The caps are pretty much grey on grey, with grey undertones.  Mostly found clustered.  No spore print was found at the time they were found.  At least they are Basidiomycota, and Agaricales.</p>
<p>But getting it under the scope, I still don&#8217;t get anywhere.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzers.  There are no cystidia on the gill, and the edge is fertile.  There is a basidia displayed in the shot, with 4 spores still attached.  The spores are non-dextrinoid and inamyloid.  Also the spores are a strange elongated pointed shape.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is at 400x of the cap surface in radial section, with Meltzers.  Here the pileipellis is seen to be a layer of gelatin about 130 um thick, with loosely embeded interwoven hyphae.  The top surface at the top of the shot, is granular from spores from another &#8217;shroom.</p>
<p>The third shot is of spores from the stipe apex in KOH at 1000&#215;.  Here the spores are hyaline, so the spore print is probably white for this species.  The spores display the funny shape, long, thin and pointed.  Some with guttules, and some whithout.</p>
<p>So, looking for a white spored, grey &#8216;shroom, non-dextrinoid, inamyloid, viscid cap, long thin pointed spores, no cystidia.  And I&#8217;ve got nothing, it doesn&#8217;t seem to match anything to genus in Largent&#8217;s Mushrooms to Genus VI, Modern Genera.</p>

So, this year I was just start calling this C. collinitus, and go with that.</p>
<p>Dimitar has suggested that these are C. trivialis, which might be true.  Looking at the web to see if there are other photos of this one, I would say it looks more like what I&#8217;ve been calling C. mucosus from the northern coast, which Dimi has another name for, which is probably better.  And he calls C. mucosus another one that is in the mountains, which kinda looks more like C. trivialis.</p>
<p>But in anycase, I&#8217;ll go with calling this C. trivialis.  But it would be good to get a better source on this, to understand the differences here.</p>
<p>Oh, one thing he suggests the gills when young should be blue.  The nicest youngest one I found here, the gills are kinda lilac-grey, not really blue.</p>

"Cuphophyllus angustifolius","2008-02-23 00:00:00 +0000","<p>These were found under CA bay, and very near a group of C. pratensis.  There are the same size, and look quite a bit like C. pratensis, but they are completely white.  They are non-viscid on cap and stipe.  Largent&#8217;s Hygrophorus of CA mention some white-capped species that look like C. pratensis:  H. cremeicolor has a creamy white cap, and yellow gills; H. angustifolius is all white but with small sized spores; and H. berkeleyi is ivory colored (not sure how to tell the difference between white, ivory and cream really&#8230;), but is moist and slightly viscid.  These were slightly damp, and really non-viscid, and all white, really white-white.  That suggests H. angustifolius, but Larget remarks that it is rare, he didn&#8217;t find it, and he only lists it from Hesler and Smith who mention it under redwoods in coastal CA.</p>
<p>3/3/2008 &#8211; looking at this some more here, and got some of it under the scope.  The first micro-shot here is of a gill section, at 100x in KOH.  Sorry about the quality of the photo, I&#8217;ll get better, but here you can see the basidia on each side of the section, and the inter-woven trama in between.  The second micro-shot is on the spores at 1000x in KOH.  Haven&#8217;t figured out how to get this is focus just yet, but you can see spores enough here.  They are sub-globose to drop shaped.  Measuring 10 spores, the ave size is 5.85 &#215; 4.7 um.  This makes these Camarophyllus, but still not sure about the species.  They were found near C. pratensis, and they were very common.  The spore size is consistant with that species, and these might be albino versions of these.  But the shape of the spores, and macro-features are consistant with C. angustifolius, although the spore size is at the large end of the size ranges for that species.  Also C. angustifolius has only been describe by Hesler and Smith, and hasn&#8217;t been seen since, so I don&#8217;t know here.</p>
<p>I now have to go and look at C. pratensis and compare.</p>
<p>3/6/2008 &#8211; Now having gone a looked at details on C. pratensis, the difference is the color, which is pure white here, and there is a difference in the spore shape and size.  The spores are smaller, but I&#8217;m not sure how consistant this is really.  But also the spore shape is different, here they are more tear-drop shaped, where in C. pratensis the spore are more elliptical.  And that is the main difference as sited in Largent&#8217;s Hygrophorus of CA.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m not entirely certain, but there is a difference, and the difference is exactly what is stated in the monograph, so I&#8217;m going to go with it.  But you could say that these might just be an albino variation of C. pratensis.  Also I wasn&#8217;t as careful about the spore size as I could have been, and more should be done with more spores and use of Congo Red to have a careful measurement here.  But I think I&#8217;m going to move on, and leave it as this, others can borrow the dried samples for further study if needed.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60658169","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97007790/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60658169,"Camarophyllus angustifolius","Fungi",361633,0,0,"2008-02-23","2008-02-23","","UTC",703,703,"","","false",NA,"",734334,"2020-09-24 22:37:00 UTC","2021-06-01 18:03:47 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC-ND",NA,NA,"false"

<p>The feel of the flesh is like other Pluteus species, if that makes sense.  The spore print from one cap over night is pinkish brown, which makes it most probably Pluteus.  The gills are mostly free&#8230;</p>
<p>Looking in the notes in Arora on other Pluteus species he comments on a large fleshy brown species, P. magnus.  So, I am calling these they.</p>
<p>3/3/2008 &#8211; Getting back to these, and getting them under the scope.  The first micro-shot here is 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s, and I think shows cheilosytidia.  But the gill  was laid face down, and it curled when getting revived in Ethanol, there is a chance these are pleurocystidia on a curved under edge.  There were lots of pleurocystidia on the gill face.</p>
<p>But the main point here is that the cystidia do not show &#8220;hooks&#8221; on the end, and only rare sub-branches and points.  Most are just simply pointed.  This removes these from P. cervinus or P. pouzarianus contention, and is more consistant with P. magnus.

"Peziza arvernensis","2008-02-10 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Ok, got these under the scope, and I kinda like how these photos turned out.  The two micro-shots are of asci in Meltzers, and they display the blue tips characteristic of the Pezizalaes family.</p>
<p>The first shot is at 400x, of a bunch of asci&#8217;s, for some reason I couldn&#8217;t find many paraphases.  I got one in another shot, and it is pretty boring, long and thin, about 5um wide, orangish.  The ascis are kinda neat in that they are red-orange when there are no spores, but fade to clear as the spores mature.</p>
<p>The second shot is of an asci with mature spores at 1000&#215;.  The spores are &#8220;finely verrucose, and eguttulate&#8221;.  The ave spore size of the 8 spores in this asci are 17.87 &#215; 9.25 microns.</p>

"Cuphophyllus pratensis","2008-02-10 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Getting back to this one, to use as a comparison to other Camarophyllus species, and adding some micro-shots.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of a gill section, at 100x in KOH.  Here it can clearly be seen the interwoven lamellar trama between the rows of basidia, so clearly a Camarophyllus species.  The next micro-shot is of a very thin gill section at 400x in KOH.  And here you can see the elongated basidia of Hygrophorus species, a row of connective cells, and again the interwoven trama, this shot doesn&#8217;t really point out anything for the id, but I thought it was a pretty good looking section.  The third micro-shot is of tissue from the upper stipe surface, to look for mature spore sizes.  Unfortunately I couldn&#8217;t find a spot with lots of spores in focus at once, so only two spore here.  This is at 1000x in KOH, and I still can&#8217;t quite get 1000x in focus in camera yet.  <br />
But here the spores have on oil drop in them, and are elliptical.</p>
<p>The ave spore sizes are : 7.06 &#215; 5.77 microns &#8211; q : 1.23, on 7 spores.  But I haven&#8217;t really calibrated the scope&#8217;s reticule yet, and I think this might be high.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is a baseline for a well known Camarophyllus species.

<p>The caps are viscid, but then again it was very wet out.  The smallest cap seems to have veil fragments on the cap margin, although these are gone from the mature caps.</p>
<p>3/15/2008 &#8211; Getting back to these guys, and got them under the scope.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here you can see the cheilocystidia on the non-fertile gill edge.  They are short and pointed.  The spores here are dark, and non-dextrinoid, and inamyloid.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the cap surface in a radial section in Meltzer&#8217;s at 400&#215;.  The pileipellis is an ixocutis.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of the spores from the stipe apex in KOH at 1000&#215;.  Here the spores are brown, with thick walls, smooth, and with a germ pore.</p>
<p>The non-dextrinoid dark smooth spores, with a germ pore, and the cutis means they are not Galerina, and I&#8217;m going to start putting these into Psilocybe.  (Does that mean I have to start looking up the monograph by Guzman here&#8230;)</p>
<p>3/22/2008 &#8211; Ok, now I&#8217;ve looked up the monograph by Guzman, and the section of Psilocybe is pretty obvious for these, but the species, I&#8217;m still not sure.  I&#8217;m going to call these P. montana, and it mostly seems to fit, except these are too light a brown, P. montana is a common temperate forest Psilocybe, that is dark brown.  There also is P. physaloides, which has been studied from California by Guzman, which is supposed to be a lighter brown, with shorter cystidia, and thin walled spores.  Or as he says &#8220;moderately thin walled, with a more or less broad germ pore&#8221;, love the definite descriptions in these things.  These spores, I am guessing are &#8220;moderately thick walled&#8221;, so I&#8217;m going to leave them as P. montana (which is the more common one), until someone can show a different observation of one of these two species.</p>","Albion, Mendocino Co., California, USA",39.22805,-123.758,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60657587","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97006882/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60657587,"Deconica inquilina","Fungi",410968,0,0,"2008-02-02","2008-02-02","","UTC",2230,2230,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 22:30:28 UTC","2020-09-24 22:30:34 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

<p>The second micro-shot is of some ascis at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here the tip of the asci isn&#8217;t blue in the stain, so not in the pezizales family.  Also the spores here are ellipsoid and fairly long.</p>

"Cryptophyton goddardi","2008-02-20 00:00:00 -0800","Described by Gary Williams (California Academy of Sciences) based on specimens from Cape Arago, Oregon, this species is now known as far south as Point San Luis, near Avila Beach in San Luis Obispo County. 

This species can be locally common under intertidal ledges and cobbles. When fully contracted, as in this image, the polyps always leave a dome-shape protuberance. Colonies are often surrounded and partially overgrown by sponges, bryozoans and other encrusting colonial invertebrates, which can obscure the colony form.

This colony was from the underside of a low intertidal cobble just north of Pigeon Point (San Mateo County, CA) and was about 35 mm long. The nudibranch <i>Tritonia festiva</i> preys on the polyps of this species, as well as on all of the other octocorals found intertidally in California and Oregon.","California, United States",37.192664,-122.400527,"soft coral, intertidal, Octocorallia, Pistachio Beach, Pigeon Point, San Mateo County, California, Cryptophyton goddardi, Cryptophyton, Clavulariidae, rocky shore, Octocoral Cryptophyton goddardi from near Pigeon Point","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/6873189","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/8764000/medium.jpg","jeffgoddard",6873189,"Cryptophyton goddardi","Animalia",424305,1,0,"2008-02-20 00:00:00","2008-02-20","2008-02-20 08:00:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false",NA,NA,216076,"2017-07-01 16:23:07 UTC","2017-10-17 18:37:01 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

This is the first spotted skunk documented in the Sagehen Basin. The animal doesn't even appear on our mammal list.

Tom Kucera ran camera traps in the Central Sierra--including Sagehen--in 1992 as part of an unsuccessful wolverine survey.
