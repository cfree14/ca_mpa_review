https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/102278702

iNat limits posts to 20 pix, so the next time I get a chance I'll put the rest of the pix in another obs.

Summary of characteristics from these _fresh_ samples:

3 rosettes from single root.
wide portion of caudex up to 20 mm long x 14 mm wide

rosettes 3.5 cm in width

lvs 19-33 per rosette

longest lf 39 x 11 mm, unpressed thickness 4.0 mm, pressed thickness 3.2 mm.

lf mostly oblong, with widest portion of leaf at middle to 1/4 length down from tip (i.e., at 0.5 - 0.75 of length of length, measured from proximal end).

cross section of leaf is strongly flattened (thickness to width ratio of 3.2 / 11 = 0.29) and only slightly curved.

peduncle 20-85 mm, 3.5 mm wide at base

infl consists of 2-3 main branches, with the branches being simple or forked into two subequal 2 deg branches.

uppermost bract (just below main infl branches) 4.5 x 3.8 to 7 x 4.5 and 8.5 x 4 mm

14-23 fls per infl

ultimate infl branches with 3-7 flowers.

pedicels 3-7 mm.

calyx 3.5-5.0 mm long (including connate portion), lobe width at base 2-4 mm

petals:
- 7.5-11 (12.2) mm, connate for 1.0-2.1 mm (13-26% of length)
- bright yellow to orange
- somewhat to markedly keeled, keel marked pink

anthers 7.0-7.5 mm, distal end below petal tips by 2.9 mm, attached at same point of corolla to having one or more antisepalous anthers attached 0.4-2.0 mm higher than others (i.e., some flowers have one attached 0 mm higher; others 0.5 mm higher; and others 2.0 mm higher). 

Disagreements with D. cymosa pumila:

- rosette with up to 33 leaves, more than the ""usually 10-25 leaved"".

- the peduncles can be shorter than 5-15 (25) cm, being as short as 2 cm.

- the petals can be shorter than 10-12 mm, being as short as 7.5 mm. 

Disagreements with just the species D. cymosa:

- the 3.5 cm rosette width is at the small end of the D. cymosa range of (3)6-15(35) cm.  However, voucher measurements might be too small, since the rosette seems to curl up once the plant leaves the ground.

- the pedicels of 3-7 mm are shorter than the ""usually 5-15 mm"" for D. cymosa.

"Hyalophora columbia gloveri","2011-07-25 00:00:00 -0500","5th instar larvae of Hyalophora gloveri

Specimens courtesy of Dr. Michael Collins

Noting the variation in coloration of the tubercles among the 5th instar larvae, populations from this area seem to be poymorphic as final instars (all larvae pictured are also siblings!). Such variation is suggestive these populations/individuals may represent past genetic exchange between genetically divergent populations of Hyalophora in this part of the Sierras (?).  Populations composed of H. gloveri & H. euryalus are known to exhibit similar larval traits.

NOTE: It is well documented that gloveri and euryalus exchange genes along parts of the Sierra Nevadas and Cascades creating some interesting blends. Dr. Collins, one of the most knowledgeable Saturniid specialists in the US, covers these points in the Wild Silk Moths of North America. 

Interestingly, the status of Hyalophora gloveri (syn. H. columbia gloveri) remains in taxonomic debate.  Although recently placed under H. columbia as a subspecies, there is emerging evidence to support its relationship to H. columbia may not be as close as previously thought.
The taxon, <i>Hyalophora columbia ssp. gloveri</i>, may be composed of several divergent populations representing distinct taxa and/or sub-taxa within the currently recognized ""columbia species group"", additional studies are needed to clarify observed differences. 

The recent synonymy of the gloveri-columbia group & their relationship(s) appear sound, but may be incomplete. The issues of morphology (adults & larvae), host affinities and relationships, reproductive compatability, blending (extent of blend zones), degrees of genetic variance,  and divergence patterns (time frames) are all continued topics & issues of discussion.

From the Shark Research Committee:

On July 20, 2011, Myung Kil was surfing at Ocean Beach, San Francisco, almost opposite Beach Chalet. It was about 8:30 AM and he had been on the water 45 minutes. The sky was clear with air and water temperatures estimated in the low 60s and 50s Fahrenheit, respectively. The ocean was calm with decent swells for good small to midsized surf. No marine mammals were observed in the area. Kil reported: “I was waiting on my board for a set, looking outbound when slightly to my left, perhaps 10 o’clock and about 25 yards away, I saw a fairly large triangle fin a good foot to foot and a half and part of the sharks brownish back exposed from the trough of an incoming swell. It was moving perpendicular to me, cruised under the incoming swell and disappeared. I don’t recall much water thrashing when the shark broke the surface. I’d seen birds dive into the ocean for baitfish previously. I waited for seconds, registering that I had seen a shark, looked at the other surfers around me then saw a decent wave to catch back to shore perhaps minutes later. The shark had a very large dorsal fin, light and water shimmered on the back end of the shark, which was visible slightly out of the swell for a moment. In the light, and water, the shark looked brownish and I would guess 8 feet in length from my perspective.” ","California, US",37.7125808976,-122.5709932993,"Shark Watch, Great White Shark","Great White Shark","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/119600","","sharksteward",119600,"Great White Shark","Animalia",50873,0,0,"July 23, 2011","2011-07-23","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",100000,100000,"","obscured","true",NA,"",6714,"2012-09-05 19:20:00 UTC","2015-08-24 21:31:23 UTC","casual","",NA,NA,"false"

"Pandion haliaetus","2011-07-19 00:00:00 -0800","I imagine Ospreys have probably nested on this smokestack-like tower at the Syar gravel-processing facility in Healdsburg for many years.  However, I never really paid attention to it until 2011, when I began participating in an update of the Sonoma County Breeding Bird Atlas.  I first noticed an Osprey sitting in the nest on February 13, 2011.  It's possible there was a small amount of new nesting material at that time, but the vast majority of nest substrate had green vegetative growth on it, indicating that it was placed there in a previous year.  An Osprey was also on the nest on March 7 and 10, and there was no obvious new material in the nest.  

On April 11, I could hear high-pitched raptor-‘screaming’ from my house.  I went outside to check it out and saw an Osprey flying relatively high within 1/4-1/2 mile of the nest on the tower.  The Osprey was swooping back and forth with its feet down, crying all the time – swoop, flap flap, swoop, flap flap....  I'm guessing this was the Sky Dance courtship display described in  the Birds of North America species account for Osprey.  There were at least two other Ospreys in the area.  I have no idea if the Osprey was associated with the nest on the tower, but I don't know of any nest-sites that are closer to where I saw the bird displaying.

On April 12, I checked the nest on the tower and saw two Ospreys in it.  It seemed to be bulkier than in early March, and I could no longer see any vegetation growing on it.  It’s possible the vegetation just died, but I think there had been some nest-building going on since March.  By May 5, the nest was pretty bulky, so that the Osprey sitting in it looked kind of small.  I don't have any more notes until July 19, when there was an adult and a close-to-fledging nestling or a juvenile sitting on the nest.  The nestling/juvenile was spreading out its wings and flapping a little.

The pictures were taken on July 19, 2011.  The bird on the right is the nestling/juvenile.  If you look carefully, you can see that it's back has white speckling on it.  The last picture shows the general habitat in the area.  The nest is on the leftmost tower.  This nest is also being used in 2012.","Healdsburg, CA",38.6058074086,-122.8585839272,"Healdsburg, Sonoma County","Osprey","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/91075","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/132763/medium.JPG","emilyheaton",91075,"Osprey","Aves",116999,3,0,"2011-07-19","2011-07-19","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,10000,"","open","false",NA,"",1203,"2012-06-14 04:08:48 UTC","2016-06-22 20:47:49 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

Her body is not so white as 
anemone petals nor so smooth--nor 
so remote a thing. It is a field 
of the wild carrot taking 
the field by force; the grass 
does not raise above it. 
Here is no question of whiteness, 
white as can be, with a purple mole 
at the center of each flower. 
Each flower is a hand's span 
of her whiteness. Wherever 
his hand has lain there is 
a tiny purple blossom under his touch 
to which the fibres of her being 
stem one by one, each to its end, 
until the whole field is a 
white desire, empty, a single stem, 
a cluster, flower by flower, 
a pious wish to whiteness gone over-- 
or nothing.
