The leaves are kind of ovate/lanceolate and have those long white awns which create the hoary look.

If you look at the the cells in the mid lower leaf they have wavy walls, one signature of the genus Grimmia. 

The cap on the sporophyte is very small and ""mitrate"" - it has little lobes.

It is growing on the trunk of a coast live oak with a moss in the genus Orthotrichum .

In the cross-section of the leaf you can see the crescent shaped group of cells (stereid band) which have thick-walls at the bottom of the midrib - in the photo they appear a bit brownish. This crescent shape signals the genus Syntrichia.

The hummingbird stayed for only a few minutes but I was able to take a good video of it. The iridescent pink head was beautiful and I would catch glimpses of it before it turned black again in different light. In the second photo you can see some of the pink. The body, tail, and wings of the bird were also a gorgeous iridescent green and it‚Äôs beak is black. It has a white eye ring around it‚Äôs eyes.

The leaf cross section shows the  elliptic shaped ""stereid band"" (the thick-walled cells which look yellowish in the photo) characteristic of the Tortula genus.

The photo of just the tip of the leaf is meant to show the relatively thick walled cells at the leaf margin - this would indicate T. muralis, along with the fact that the leaf margins are recurved nearly to the apex of the leaf as seen in the full leaf photo.","Santa Barbara County, CA, USA",34.4590645052,-119.777816534,"","Wall Screw-moss","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/20926994","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/32299099/medium.jpeg","amanda_h",20926994,"Wall Screw-Moss","Plantae",123498,0,0,"2019/03/03 4:36 AM PST","2019-03-03","2019-03-03 12:36:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",15,15,"","","false","","",416546,"2019-03-03 23:36:42 UTC","2019-03-03 23:47:24 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC","",NA,"false"
