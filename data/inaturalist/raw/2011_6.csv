"Dudleya cymosa","2011-06-15 00:00:00 -0800","The location and observation date is intentionally obscured, since this is the only location we've seen this species at San Jacinto Mountain.  There were only ten plants seen; this observation, and the following eight, show nine of those plants.

These plants were first spotted by James Dillane in 2007.  Dave Stith relocated them in on this trip in 2011.

These are almost surely the same plants as in Jaeger's 1921 voucher from ""Tahquitz Ridge - desert side - 9000 feet elevation"" (which has an erroneous elevation, since the highest point on Tahquitz Ridge is 8792 feet).

Jaeger's voucher was originally determined as ""D. abramsii"" by Reid Moran, who cites this voucher as ""D. abramsii"" in his 1951 Dudleya monograph.

That voucher was redetermined as ""D. cymosa aff. ssp. pumila"" in 1988.  Nakai wrote:

<blockquote>
Moran (1951) listed two populations of D. abramsii from the San Jacinto Mountains, one from near Kenworthy [Munz 5788 (POM)] and the other from Taquitz (sic) Ridge, 9000 ft (2770 m) [Jaeger in 1921 (POM)]. The population near Kenworthy is D. abramsii, but differs from typical D. abramsii by lacking the characteristic red striations along the petal midrib.

<p>&nbsp;<p>The specimen from Tahquitz Ridge differs considerably from the Kenworthy population in its comparatively broad, oblong to ovate leaves and short floral stem. It resembles no specimens of D. abramsii that I have studied. 

...


The status of these populations is uncertain until more material can be studied, but it appears they are not D. abramsii.
</blockquote>

Some measurements I made in the field:

rosette width is 3.5 cm.

leaf length x width: 30 x 11; 17 x 5; 12 x 6 mm for the largest leaves.  Hence the leaf length is 12 to 30 mm; the leaf width is 5 to 11 mm; and the ratio of width to length is 0.29 to 0.50.

peduncle length is 2.5 to 4.0 cm.

these plants have 1 deg infl branches that are branched zero to one times, although one of the plants in this series of posts might be branched two times.

the # of flowers on each ultimate infl branch is 3 to 4.

pedicel length.  This was very hard to measure in the field.  I measured the longest at 7 mm, and my pix show some at 4 mm.

i measured just one flower, with sepals of 3.5 mm and petals of 10 mm.

Summary of all my measurements compared to D. abramsii and D. cymosa:

- 2 fit only D. cymosa (both key characteristics)

- 1 favors D. cymosa.

"Schoenoplectus acutus","2011-06-30 13:33:07 -0600","One of the more widespread and abundant bulrushes in North America. The stems are round in cross-section and the main inflorescence bract appears as a continuation of the main stem. This population grows near Clearlake Oaks, California.

Hardstem bulrush is one of the most common perennial rhizomatous emergent aquatics in Montana. It forms extensive dense stands along the margins of ponds, lakes, and sloughs. The green cylindrical stems stand upwards of 1-2 m tall and are often about 1 cm in diameter. The floral bracts or scales are grayish with reddish veins or lines and the scales terminate in a twisted awn measuring about 1-2 mm long. Schoenoplectus is very similar to the genus Scirpus because of inflorescence with more than one spikelet terminating a flowering stem and its flower with an ovary having a thin style. However, the inflorescence of Schoenoplectus, like that of Eleocharis, is not surrounded by leafy involucral bracts but rather by one narrow bract that appears like a continuation of the main stem.

Note that the color of this animal is different than usually found in D. albopunctata. It is orange-red while other animals of this species are often yellow. Although the gill is often white, D. albopunctata is also known to have a tan gill. The color here is sililar to D. gemela, but D. gemela is usually orange or white-orange rather than red-orange. This color variation has been observed several times at this site, but never elsewhere.

"Tyto alba","2011-06-17 00:00:00 -0800","On May 16, 2011, I could hear “scheuh”ing coming from this owl box at about 11pm.  I stayed for about 20 minutes and no parents came.  I revisited the box on either May 17 or May 20 (see below).  I arrived at dusk (~9pm) and could once again hear “scheuh”ing at the box.  After about 20 minutes, I could hear the clicking of a Barn Owl in the nearby oak savannah.  Eventually, I saw a Barn Owl fly to the box.  Soon, it was up on top of the box – if it delivered food it did so very quickly.  It was standing on the box top for awhile and I got some pictures of its silhouette.  It flew off.  A little later, an owl flew out of the box.  I wondered where it came from and thought maybe the female had been in the box with the young.  Then a little later, another owl flew out of the box.  I think I may have been watching young fledge! (Or maybe they had already fledged but were roosting in the box during the day.)  I could see 2 owl silhouettes against the sky, sitting on vineyard trellising.  They were flapping their wings, not going anywhere, and looked unsteady.  It also seemed like they were bobbing their heads up and down, side-to-side, and around in circles.  I could hear them “scheuh”ing.  After awhile, a third owl flew in and things got a little chaotic.  One of the owls on the trellis seemed to fall off, and I lost track of the owls.  I couldn’t tell if the one that flew in had food.  In about 5 minutes, one of the presumed fledglings was visible on a telephone post in the same area, “scheuh”ing.

*Note: Based on my notes and my memory, I believe the date of these observations was June 17.

"Colaptes auratus","2011-06-11 00:00:00 -0800","I first noticed this nest on May 10, 2011, when a male Northern Flicker was looking out of the cavity.  The male was looking out again on May 17, and then it backed down into the cavity.  On June 11 and 12, I saw the parents feed nestlings at the nest multiple times.  On June 11, I was able to see 3 nestlings.  They were fully feathered but the egg tooth was still visible.  The nest was in an alder(?) snag, along West Slough.

I have posted a few videos on YouTube that show the male and female feeding the nestlings (http://youtu.be/PFISMbqf3Yw, http://youtu.be/VdT5ywXNEG0).  In the video with the male, you can see that he seems to be feeding the nestlings by regurgitation.  The Northern Flicker species account in the Birds of North America says: ""Pharynx of adult expands to form a crop, which is engorged, particularly with ant larvae, when adult returns to nest. Young fed by regurgitation.""  The video with the male also shows him removing a fecal sac.

The pictures that I've posted here show the male approaching the nest cavity (June 12), the male removing a fecal sac (June 12), one of the parents feeding a nestling (June 11), a nestling looking out of the nest (June 11), and the nest-site.

"Cathartes aura","2011-06-12 00:00:00 -0800","I found this Turkey Vulture fledgling hanging out by itself in a small canyon on Fitch Mountain in Healdsburg.  It had fluffy white, downy feathers around its neck and on its breast and belly; it also had some down on the back of its head.  It was sitting in a tree only about 10 feet from Riverview Dr (a dirt road where cars aren’t allowed).  Though it was probably about 10 feet up in the tree, because it was on a steep slope below the road, the vulture was at eye level. I actually didn’t notice it when I walked past (I guess it was screened well enough by the broom growing on the side of the road). I only noticed it when I rounded a bend in the road and was ~30m away from it.  It was pretty-well camouflaged in the dense hardwood forest, so I'm not sure how I saw it.  I think I just felt its presence and looked over in its direction.  It was a lucky find.

I took pictures (terrible lighting) from only 10 feet away and it didn’t move.  I’m pretty certain I could hear it quietly hissing at me – the same sound I heard coming from a nest that I once found in Hopland in Mendocino County, though not nearly as loud.  My guess is that this vulture would have flown away were it able to do so.  I’m not sure where it nested.  The tree it was sitting on didn’t look like a good candidate.  There was a larger tree nearby, but I didn’t see any large cavities.","Riverview Rd, Healdsburg, CA",38.6221533116,-122.8412944078,"Fitch Mountain, Healdsburg, Sonoma County","Turkey Vulture","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/91078","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/132772/medium.jpg","emilyheaton",91078,"Turkey Vulture","Aves",4756,3,0,"2011-06-12","2011-06-12","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","open","false",NA,"",1203,"2012-06-14 05:02:54 UTC","2020-07-22 00:21:07 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
"Buteo lineatus","2011-06-16 00:00:00 -0800","I first observed activity at this nest on March 14, 2011.  I heard a Red-shouldered Hawk calling in a residential neighborhood and then found a hawk sitting in a nest near the top of a scraggly-looking pine tree (most of the needles were near the top).  A second Red-shouldered Hawk was in the area calling.  The hawk in the nest left and they circled around a bit, then flew out of the area.

A month later, on April 14, there was a hawk sitting in the nest (I could see its tail extending out from the side of the nest).  I waited 5 minutes, and then a second Red-shouldered Hawk quietly flew in (no calling).  The one on the nest stood up.  They were both in the nest for about a minute.  Then the first hawk flew off.  It called a few times as it flew off, not very loudly and not until it was a little ways from the nest.  The second hawk sat down in the nest and settled in.  It still seemed to be in same position about 15 minutes later. 

On May 19, 2011, there were two small downy nestlings in the nest.  There was no sign of the parents.  I was in the area for about 10-15 minutes.

On June 16, 2011, there were two large nestlings in the nest.  When I first arrived, there was only one in the nest and I was worried that the other had been blown out in the gusty wind the night before.  But after about 10 minutes, the second nestling jumped down into the nest.  Later, one was climbing on the branches above the nest.  I stayed for about 1 hour, but the parents never came.  The young were calling.

Pictures: the pictures were taken on June 16.  The last picture shows the nest tree, with the nest circled in red.  The nest was not very substantial and was placed on the outer part of a limb.

"Actinidia","2011-06-15 00:00:00 -0700","Actinidiaceae, Actinidia indica, Kiwifruit
The Actinidia genus contains over 400 species, most of which are native to East Asia, China in particular. Although the Chinese collected and used the fruit from the wild for thousands of years, the New Zealanders are responsible for growing and developing various kiwifruits.

Different Actinidia species vary widely, in color, shape, size and edibility.  Most kiwi vary in their cold hardiness. Until the mid 1880s the main cultivated kiwifruit was Actinidia chinensis var. hispida.

The first A. chinensis fruits in New Zealand were derived from a few seeds from a single fruit brought from China by a woman named Miss Isabel Fraser. It is thus highly possible that most commercial kiwifruits grown around the world originate fromt his single fruit, also indicating that the genetic base of the fruit is very limited.

One of the main reasons kiwifruit have seen so much commercial popularity is because they store so well, from 4-6 months at freezing. This makes shipping easier and the fruit can be transported around the world.

Kiwis are primarily grown in New Zealand, California, Italy, Japan, France, Chile, China, Spain, Greece, and Israel.

Kiwi vines are vigorous and long-lived. A healthy vine will typically grow 6-8 meters wide and 3-4 meters tall. The trunk becomes woody and can measure more then 20 cm in diameter when mature.

The vine is deciduous. Leaves are large, dark green, and hairy. As leaves mature they loose hairs on their upper surface and develop a distinct, white downy surface with light colored veins.

The flowers are large (16-20 cm diameter), creamy white, and often fragrant. Flowers are born singly or in small clusters. See Photo.

Plants are usually dioecious, meaning they need more then one plant in order to cross-pollinate and bear fruit. Hermaphroditic varieties do exist. Bees are the usual pollinators however, unfortunately for Kiwi growers, bees aren’t particularly attracted to the flowers, thus the presence of a nearby hive, or hand-pollination, will increase fruit-set and fruit-size.

Fruit size is proportional to the number of pollinated embryos, and thus the number of seeds. A kiwi needs more then 1000 embryos to be pollinated to become a good-sized fruit.

Male and female plants can be of different species and still cross-pollinate, but in order to do so their flowers must open simultaneously.

The fruit is oval, both the shape and size of a chicken egg. They have a brown, fuzzy skin. Inside are small, black, edible seeds embedded in a green flesh.

Kiwi are high in chlorophyll, thus the emerald-green hue of their flesh.

Interestingly, kiwi fruit doesn’t degrade after being opened, or exposed, as is the case with most fruits. This is also due to the high chlorophyll content.

Mature kiwi vines can produce 150 – 200 fruit. Maximum seasonal yields from a single is around 80 kilos.  Plants will typically begin to produce around four years old and reach maximum production at around ten years.

As far as cultivation goes: Kiwi are demanding plants in terms of soil quality, nutrients, and moisture. Vines are wind sensitive. Excess wind can snap branches. They can be grown in full sun or part shade, and are neither tolerant of high salt nor maritime locations. Primarily kiwi species prefer warm, temperate to subtropical climates. Plants can survive temperatures down to – 12 C, but not for extended periods of time. Young vines will be killed easily at these low temps. Kiwi require a period of winter chill to initiate leaf and flower bud opening during springtime. Vines grow best in deep, fertile soil. They can handle a wide pH range, from 5.5 to 7.2, however, pH adaptability depends on overall soil type. Kiwi like water, but not waterlogging, they require more moisture then many other fruit species.

As far as nutrition goes: Kiwi have a higher concentration of vitamins and minerals then most other fruits. They are very high in antioxidants and are a good source of fiber and one of the best sources of vitamin C. Kiwi have unusually high levels of vitamin E, possibly contained in their tiny black seeds.","910 Hilldale ave, berkeley, california",37.895453,-122.263179,"berkeley, fruit, suburban, food, city, California, kiwi, actinidia, woodard, foraging, urbanKi","","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/21918","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/39121/medium.JPG","anthropogen",21918,"Actinidia indica","Plantae",55151,0,0,"2011-06-15","2011-06-15","","Arizona",NA,NA,"","","false",NA,NA,1899,"2011-06-17 17:52:24 UTC","2016-03-01 17:03:53 UTC","casual","",NA,NA,"true"
