"Corvus brachyrhynchos","2012-11-24 00:00:00 -0800","American Crows are familiar over much of the continent: large, intelligent, all-black birds with hoarse, cawing voices. They are common sights in treetops, fields, and roadsides, and in habitats ranging from open woods and empty beaches to town centers. They usually feed on the ground and eat almost anything – typically earthworms, insects and other small animals, seeds, and fruit but also garbage, carrion, and chicks they rob from nests. Their flight style is unique, a patient, methodical flapping that is rarely broken up with glides. Crows are rarely found alone.

"Lynx rufus","2012-11-21 00:00:00 -1000","At dusk a mob of scolding jays drew my attention to a large nest in an oak tree at Guadalupe Oak Grove Park in San Jose, Ca. In the fading light I could make out the silhouette of what I first thought was a Great Horned Owl. But this nest didn't look like any Great Horned Owl nest I'd seen; it was the leafy nest of a squirrel. Through binoculars I could see that it was a bobcat in the tree. It is still a little hard to believe a bobcat would fit in this nest. Although it was large for a squirrels nest, it seems like it would be a bit cramped for a bobcat. 

The details I could see through binoculars don't show up in the photo, nor does the photo capture the green-gold of the eyeshine.","Guadalupe Oak Grove Park, San Jose, CA",37.2360163955,-121.8780523083,"","Bobcat","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/151988","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/208896/medium.JPG","barbarab",151988,"Bobcat","Mammalia",41976,1,0,"2012-11-21","2012-11-21","","Hawaii",NA,NA,"","","false",NA,"",462,"2012-11-24 05:14:28 UTC","2021-05-08 19:25:08 UTC","research","CC-BY",NA,NA,"false"

"Podilymbus podiceps","2012-11-21 00:00:00 -0800","Amidst the coots, mallards, and winter visitors such as ring-necked ducks and buffleheads, there is always one lone pied-billed grebe that cruises around the Big Rock reservoir. Mostly minding his own business, but if he spies me peering at him from a nearby window he quickly disappears under the water. It's funny, he just drops - not a dive like when he's foraging for food. He simply disappears, and then makes his escape after surfacing several yards away.","Big Rock Ranch, Nicasio, CA",38.0516057218,-122.6273775101,"grebe marin big rock","Pied-billed Grebe","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/151193","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/258080/medium.jpg","billyverde",151193,"Pied-billed Grebe","Aves",4246,2,0,"2012-11-21","2012-11-21","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","open","false","","",7448,"2012-11-22 00:50:04 UTC","2017-10-04 07:23:23 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

The photo shows it before it dragged its meal out of view, and gives a sense of scale (scarcely bigger than the darker shadow of the dead pigeon at its feet), build and coloration.

It struck me as a falcon while watching the hunt.

"Aneides lugubris","2012-11-03 00:00:00 -0800","Observed a salamander last night in the garage at around 8:30PM after frantic mother called me on the phone, thinking that it was a sick baby lizard. 

She shone a flashlight on it, and we observed it as it slowly crawled from the outside driveway pavement, into the garage  door crevice, and finally, into the garage where we were standing. Had no idea what it was and looked it up on the laptop, and discovered that it was not a sickly baby lizard at all, but rather, an Arboreal Salamander (Please feel free to correct me--I'm still an amateur at identification and would love to learn something new).

Front and hind legs were raw pink, and the top of its body, from head to tail, appeared to be a dark black-brown murky color. Skin appeared moist, and along the length of its body, from a birds-eye view, were lines similar to those of a roly-poly or millipede, where it could curl up easily. Its tail also appeared to be flexible and easy to curl.

While I had been looking up what the creature was, my mother of her own accord had coaxed it onto a plant tray lined with an old shirt. She did not want to risk running over it in the garage, so we found an oak tree by the house with plenty of holes and cover, and other trees nearby. The ground was still wet from the recent rain. 

On the tray, it had been quite still. But as soon as I held the tray up next to the oak tree, it quickly became active and crawled up onto the bark--thus, it was there that we released it.
