"Charadrius vociferus","2010-03-13 00:00:00 -0800","I seen this bird at a wonderful nursery that I like to visit called the North Coast Native Nursery in Petaluma,CA.  Operated by Dave Kaplan it's a wonderful place to find healthy, robust natives of all kinds different applications ( www.northcoastnativenursery.com ). The nursery is situated in the middle of a valley where during the spring the low grasslands become a sort of large vernal marsh. Driving up to the nursery there I found a pair of killdeers in the middle of the dirt road leading up to the greenhouses. Upon closer inspection I found that the pair of mating killdeers had built their nests smack dab in the middle of the dirt road. Eggs well hidden along side the gravel could be barely seen. I was astonished by the incredibly bold birds that would dare such a nest site. The pair would put on a broken wing display to draw the lumbering half ton vehicles up the driveway away from the nest. Each time tire treads coming within inches of crushing the ever fragile eggs. Either these birds were incredibly brave or stupid I could not tell. What I did notice that there was a mass of insects, tadpoles, small frogs and other tasty meals surrounding the nest site. Thankfully enough for the killdeer they are precocial meaning within a few moments from their birth they are walking around. A handy feature when you awake to the world in the middle of a road.
