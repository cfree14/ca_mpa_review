I forget which new name for the genus he mentioned, and he couldn&#8217;t remember the new species name.  But there is a note in Arora&#8217;s MD that G. californica is a synonym for H. californica, so I have put this observation here.</p>
<p>If I find the new species name at some point, I&#8217;ll update these observations.</p>
<p>Given how he remarked that this was a rare sighting, kinda brings into question my other observation of this species from May.  But those did have whitish wrinked backs, behind the brick red fertile surface.  Although those did look more like Gyromitra and this one does look more like a Helvella, who knows.  But it does bring up the fact that I shouldn&#8217;t have been so quick to just photo the other observation material, and toss it out.</p>

THe main macro feature I guess is the smell, these are indistinct, slightly fungal, really just not smelly.  But the H. marzuolus is supposed to have a strong smell of mice cages, or I guess gerbal cages.  There was one sample of H. marzuolus found this week, but I didn&#8217;t see it, so I didn&#8217;t get a chance to compare.  Also looking in Largent&#8217;s Hygrophorus of CA, the spores are supposed to be different size and shape between the two.  But the H. marzuolus disappeared before I could check that also.</p>
<p>A few of these were brough in this year, but still not able to compare enough to be able tell the difference between these and H. marzuolus in the future.  But they both seem to be fairly rare mushrooms, that maybe it doesn&#8217;t matter than much.  I&#8217;ll try to let it go.</p>","Bassetts, Sierra Co., California, USA",39.616,-120.5845,"","arched woodwax","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60650292","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/96995046/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60650292,"Hygrophorus camarophyllus","Fungi",499750,0,0,"2007-06-08","2007-06-08","","UTC",5650,5650,"","","false",NA,NA,734334,"2020-09-24 21:17:12 UTC","2020-09-24 21:17:16 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

A millipede,Tylobolus claremontus(?), was being attacked by another creature as shown above. I was unsure which was attacking which until I separated the two and the black and yellow attacker searched for the millipede again and essentially grabbed it by the throat and then wrapped its body around the head. I separated them again, this time leaving the predator near the tail of the millipede. The
predator searched briefly and then crawled along the entire length of its prey and again attacked the head area.

This was my second millipede of the day, having spotted a yellow-spotted millipede, Harpaphe haydeniana, while at Huddart Park with a group of kids from East Palo Alto.

The death scene must have lasted at least ten minutes, certainly time to get the camera and to interject myself into this life and death struggle. While my instinct was to free the millipede from the death threat, I felt that life must go on and that at times we must not interfere with the natural
flow of nature and allow things to come to their natural conclusion. What I observed was the female larviform of the adult phase of the Railroad Beetle.
