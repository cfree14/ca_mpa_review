Seems consistently separated ecologically and morphologically from other varieties of L. foeniculaceum, and maintains uniform phenotype in the White Mountains and eastern California.  The disjunct reports from northeastern Nevada and southern Idaho may or may not be as distinct, but almost certainly are not part of the same biological entity.

One of two color forms in the White Mountains, this cream colored variant found in sandy and gravelly soils derived mainly from siliceous rock (granite, sandstone) in the Crooked Creek drainage, and was also seen in 1987 at 12420 ft elevation northeast of White Mountain Peak.  The form with bright yellow flowers is more widely distributed in the White Mountains, usually on carbonate substrates.  The two forms seem to maintain distinct populations, but apparently are otherwise indistinguishable.

One of two color forms in the White Mountains, this cream colored variant found in sandy and gravelly soils derived mainly from siliceous rock (granite, sandstone) in the Crooked Creek drainage, and was also seen in 1987 at 12420 ft elevation northeast of White Mountain Peak.  The form with bright yellow flowers is more widely distributed in the White Mountains, usually on carbonate substrates.
