"Empidonax difficilis difficilis","2012-05-23 15:12:00 -1000","Nesting individuals well within subsp range:

There are three subspecies of Empidonax difficilis, following Johnson (Johnson 1980b), that are diagnosed on the wing chord, bill length, and various aspects of plumage saturation (Johnson 1980b, Pyle 1997d). Note confusion in some older sources between E. difficilis and E. bairdi (Sclater, 1958), the type of which proved to be a specimen of E. affinis, the Pine Flycatcher (Van Rossem 1934d).

E. d. difficilis Baird, 1858. Includes E. bairdi perplexus Nelson, 1900; E. d. culiacani Moore, 1940; and E. albigularis subtilis Moore, 1940 (per Phillips 1960). Breeds in Pacific states and provinces from southeastern Alaska south to the Sierra San Pedro Mártir of northern Baja California [type locality = Ft. Tejon, California]; overwinters in western Mexico, both in southern Baja California and along the Pacific coast from Sinaloa south to Michoacán and occasionally to Oaxaca. Breast moderately bright greenish yellow; wingbars dark ochre-buff (juvenile) to pale lemon (adult); wing short (generally, male P7 < 68 mm) and bill short (male culmen < 8.4 mm).","Santa Barbara County, CA, USA",34.7746819831,-120.5700052969,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/18787813","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/28776342/medium.jpeg","mccreedy",18787813,"Empidonax difficilis difficilis","Aves",723289,2,0,"2012/05/23 3:12 PM HST","2012-05-23","2012-05-24 01:12:00 UTC","Hawaii",31,31,"","open","false",NA,"",758510,"2018-12-02 23:43:43 UTC","2021-03-02 05:37:38 UTC","research","",NA,NA,"false"

Pictures are from all directions. Very small habitat parcel, that was
plowed within 48hours of this DOR. Why do they plow needlessly, when
they can just mow the property, if fire control is an issue? This kind
of needless mismanagement of habitats needs to stop.

It's amazing to see such an old snake
living in such a small habitat section.


57 inch Snout to tail Length (large portion of tail is missing do to injury).
54 inch Snout to Vent Length.


Depositing snake into LA County Natural History Museum for future DNA Studies as this habitat has been isolated for many years. After deposit I will enter record number and tie it to this record. LACNHM#183241

Two years ago I found a dead female Sooty Shearwater on the beach near Monterey, California that had been banded 14 years earlier as an adult at her nest hole on an island off the coast of New Zealand. 

They can be identified by their overall chocolatey-brown coloration, silvery-white underwings, long, thin bill, and more sloping forehead that the very similar Short-tailed Shearwater (P. tenuirostris).

Albatrosses and other members of the avian order Procellariiformes spend the vast majority of their lives over the open ocean, only coming to land to breed. Luckily, Monterey Bay's deep water submarine canyon often brings these giants (80"" wingspan) within a few miles of shore.

Mike Baehr reported:
“I was surfing in front of the channel, along with two other surfers. One was on the East Channel side of the ‘groin’ (jetty) with the other surfer and I on the West side. The surfer on the channel side yelled ‘Shark!’ and we all paddled in. Right about at the outer bar and perhaps 50 feet east of the ‘groin,’ and 60 feet from shore, was what appeared to be a young seal struggling mightily. Both of the other surfers observed, more than once, a dorsal fin about 2 feet high. I did not see the shark and only witnessed the seal fighting for its life. It was thrashed around quite a bit and eventually disappeared. There was a flock of birds hovering closely over the battle scene the whole time. They left once it was over. We did not see the shark again after that, though another seal did find its way out of the channel and head west. I had been surfing that spot only about 30 minutes earlier and am feeling pretty lucky.” ","California, US",37.9609136459,-122.7532852269,"Great white shark, sea stewards, shark watch, surfers","Great White Shark","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/86087","","sharksteward",86087,"Great White Shark","Animalia",50873,0,0,"2012-05-25","2012-05-25","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",100000,100000,"","obscured","true","","",6714,"2012-06-02 19:53:38 UTC","2021-09-24 18:33:51 UTC","casual","",NA,NA,"false"

I was surprised to find a turtle here, and was especially excited to find a young one - I've never seen one before.  It was only about 2.5 inches long and had a noticeable tail (I think it's tucked around and sticking out from the left side in the picture).  Although there is not much in the way of riparian habitat along this creek, I'd guess that at least portions remain wet year-round, as there were lots of small fish and a Belted Kingfisher flew through the area.

I'm assuming this was a western pond turtle, since the location was pretty remote.  I can't imagine that an introduced species would be hanging out here.

"Myiarchus cinerascens","2012-05-22 00:00:00 -0800","On May 16, I heard an Ash-throated Flycatcher calling on the wooded hillside to the east of Fox Pond.  About 30m from the trail, I noticed a snaggy-looking, vertical limb with a broken/open top and a woodpecker hole not far below (two different entrances for the same cavity).  I wondered if perhaps the flycatcher might be nesting in there.  Within a few minutes, an Ash-throated Flycatcher appeared on the rim of the broken top.  It had a nice piece of fur in its bill.  Eventually, it flew off.  Perhaps it was disturbed by my presence.  I waited for awhile but there was no more activity at the tree.  I revisited the same location on May 22 and saw an Ash-throated Flycatcher perched in the same place.  After a few minutes, it dropped down into the limb through the open top.  Cool!

The photos I've posted are from May 22.  Unfortunately, I only got blurry pictures of the flycatcher when it was carrying the fur.

"Antrozous pallidus","2012-05-15 19:51:08 -0700","I originally thought it was an Antrozous pallidus (Pallid Bat), but the ears aren't long enough. The overall bat size is a bit too big to be a local myotis species. Any thoughts on the ID?
Here are my observations about its physical characteristics:
Head and body 66 mm
Tail 33 mm
Nose to tail 99 mm
No keeled calcar
No ""free-tail"", tail extends to tip of membrane
Forearm length 2-1/4 inch
Ears 20 mm
Flat, forward-pointing ears. Not pointed at the end.
Pointed tragus
No fringe
No hair on feet
No nose leaf
Nostrils forward-facing
Nostrils distinct but maybe not ""pig-like"".
Dorsal fur: pale at roots, tipped brown
Ventral fur: white
No yellow colors
Light-colored ears and face
Found dead, no ""white nose"" fungus observed. 
My student Hailey Williams brought this in. She has several bats roosting in her neighborhood.

"Dryobates pubescens","2012-05-12 00:00:00 -0800","I first noticed woodpecker activity at this location on April 4, when I saw a male and female (presumably a pair) in the area and noticed one of them working on a new, round hole in the rotted limb of a black(?) oak.  On April 30, a male was quietly hanging out in a nearby oak.  On May 12, I heard young calling in the area and was thrilled to see a female woodpecker come to a nest cavity in the rotted limb. I stayed for about an hour and saw the female come to the nest about 4 times.  The male finally showed up as I was leaving.  The young were calling almost constantly the whole time I was there.  Through my scope, I could see their bills when the parents came to feed them.  An added bonus was watching a Pacific-slope Flycatcher nest-building in the same tree! 

I was certain these were Downy Woodpeckers while in the field, based on general size and calls that I've heard in that area (not the emphatic ""peek"" of a Hairy Woodpecker; also, I'm pretty sure I've heard some whinnying in that area in past years).  While I do sometimes have trouble telling Hairies and Downies apart, I don't remember having much confusion over this woodpecker's id while in the field.  But then I checked the only decent photo that I took (of the female), and now I'm not so sure.  I guess I'll have to go back out there and nail down the species id.  But any comments are welcome.

Update: 5/16/12 - I went back out to get some more pictures of the woodpeckers today.  I'm pretty certain they're Downy Woodpeckers.  I've added a few pictures of the male that show a good amount of black barring on the tail, and the male's bill doesn't look quite as large as the female's.  For what it's worth, the female was flicking her tongue in and out, and I think my photo caught a bit of her tongue, making the bill look a little longer than it really was.  I've seen some Hairy Woodpeckers in the last few months, and the bills on the Healdsburg Ridge woodpeckers don't seem as large as what I've come to expect from a Hairy.  Though I have to say, they don't seem as stubby as a typical Downy bill, either.  In the field, the cavity really seems like the perfect size for a Downy -it's pretty small.  I've posted a video on YouTube at http://youtu.be/Nk3fSUuSfsg that shows both the female and the male coming to the nest.

I also posted a picture of the nest-tree here.  The cavity is circled in white and is pretty much in the center of the picture.","Healdsburg Ridge Open Space Preserve, Healdsburg, CA",38.6384947985,-122.8564542532,"Healdsburg, Sonoma County","Downy Woodpecker","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/79516","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/117349/medium.JPG","emilyheaton",79516,"Пушистый дятел","Aves",792988,1,0,"2012-05-12","2012-05-12","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","open","false","","",1203,"2012-05-16 07:29:43 UTC","2018-11-05 21:42:05 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

As far as I can tell it is only individual trees and is not widespread in the area.

Within a week of this posting I got reports of a flush of adult oak moths on the campus. 

Also note in Photo 2 in the bark fissure are several Tussock Moth cases of tan and brown","Stanford, CA",37.4326864968,-122.1665476688,"","California Oak Moth","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/78943","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/116574/medium.JPG","bob-dodge",78943,"California Oak Moth","Insecta",83958,1,0,"2012-05-12","2012-05-12","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false","","",549,"2012-05-14 17:34:51 UTC","2020-06-03 10:57:07 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

I removed them early because I found that the 'hybrids' had a respectable morphine content.  Since in a professional capacity I'd worked for years with opioid addicts, I thought that their existence in my garden could prove an embarrassment.

While I've no doubt that a preferred P. somniferum cultivar would be more productive in making the alkaloid, the amounts here were not negligible.  A speck of sap shaken in distilled water gave a strong reaction with an commercial immunoassay test; so did a drop of that solution put into a liter.

I dismissed it as a coyote, but soon after a Common Loon in breeding plumage floated into view. What a beautiful bird, especially on the misty lake.
