"Anyphaena pacifica","2018-06-02 03:38:00 -0700","Found at lights before dawn.  Can be a tough call between californica and this species and Platnick 1974 says the palps are variable. Given the inland location (californica is largely coastal per Platnick) and the RTA shape of this specimen, I think pacifica is the best fit, although the ventral palp view is certainly not far from californica.
