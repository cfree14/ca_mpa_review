"Pluvialis dominica","2009-09-07 16:15:00 -0700","I recently found this old digiscoped photo I took of a juvenile American Golden Plover on Salinas River State Beach in Moss Landing. It was identified by its exceptionally long primary projection and by the smudginess of its brownish ear spot. This is in comparison to the expected short primaries of a Pacific Golden Plover and their darker, more sharply defined ear spots.","Salinas River state Beach",36.7898949019,-121.793564558,"","American Golden-Plover","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/10738187","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/15006393/medium.jpg","rjadams55",10738187,"American Golden-Plover","Aves",4893,3,0,"2009/09/07 4:15 PM PDT","2009-09-07","2009-09-07 23:15:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",35,35,"","open","false",NA,"",108450,"2018-04-09 21:51:20 UTC","2022-02-28 19:35:52 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
