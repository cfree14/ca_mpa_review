<p>This one was getting passed around as a strange Cortinarius.  Me and Prof. Desjardin looked it over and agreed that the gills didn&#8217;t look right for Cort, even though it had clear cortina-like veil fragments on the stipe.  He put a gill quickly under the scope, and saw it was an Inocybe, and that the basidia were pigmented.  So, it is a member of section Malocybe of genus Inocybe.

"Crepidotus mollis","2009-11-07 00:00:00 +0000","<p>These are hygrophanous, and viscid.  I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve seen C. mollis as hygrophanous before, although it needs to be viscid.  I need to get these under the scope at some point.</p>
<p>Adding some micro-details:</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of gill and cap material in Meltzer&#8217;s at 400&#215;.  I had grabbed a gill here to look at spores, but some surface material came along, and here is the textured surface hyphae distinctive to this species.  Also it is lacking clamp connections.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of spores from the gill at 1000x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here the spores are ellipsoid and smooth, many are slightly pointed.  Ave spore : length &#8211; 8.59 +/- 0.62 (err 0.16) um, width &#8211; 5.82 +/- 0.30 um (err: 0.09) &#8211; q : 1.48 +/- 0.09, on 16 spores.</p>
<p>This is rather distinctive to C. mollis, and agrees well with the &quot;Crepidotus of North America of Hesler and Smith.  But in a new work on Creps. &#8220;Il genere Crepidotus in Europa&#8221; this agrees even better with C. calolepis var. squamulosus.  Which they have as a Crep. found in the Mediterranean, so it might be a stretch to have this as found on the California coast.  So, if there is any argument, well you can have it either way.</p>","Salt Point State Park, Sonoma Co., California, USA",38.57535,-123.313,"","Peeling Oysterling","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60677341","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97041486/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60677341,"Peeling Oysterling","Fungi",118283,0,0,"2009-11-07","2009-11-07","","UTC",3217,3217,"","","false",NA,"",734334,"2020-09-25 02:37:35 UTC","2020-10-01 19:14:48 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC-ND",NA,NA,"false"

<p>12/15/2009 &#8211; Got these under the scope on 12/13 here, to record the features.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  There is lots of cheilocystidia here, they are fusiod-ventricose with blunt ends.  There was also pleurocystidia obs., numerous and obvious.  The spores are dextrinoid and from mostly 2-spored basidia, there were a number of 3-spored basidia obs.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the stipe apex at 400x in KOH.  Here there a number of caulocystidia in a clump, also similar to the cheilocystidia.  There were no caulocystidia obs. at the stipe base.  Also clamp connections were obs. here.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of a spore at 1000x in KOH.  The spores are ellipsoid, pointed, roughened with a plage, and apr. 10 um long.  This isn&#8217;t really a great shot here, but the plage is shown fairly well.</p>

<p>This comparison illustrates some of the non-microscopic field marks that I have been using to separate the two species.</p>
<p><a href=""http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/lookup_name/Boletus+truncatus""><i>Boletus truncatus</i></a> usually has a relatively more robust stem with the red color concentrated towards the apex and descending in distinct scales, and a darker and less areolate-cracked pileus.</p>
<p><a href=""http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/lookup_name/Boletus+chrysenteron""><i>Boletus chrysenteron</i></a> has a more slender appearance, with the red coloration more oriented towards the bottom of the stipe and with less prominent &#8220;red-scales-on-yellow background&#8221; appearance.</p>
<p>The spores of photo 4 are <a href=""http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/lookup_name/Boletus+truncatus""><i>B. truncatus</i></a>, and those of <a href=""http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/lookup_name/Boletus+chrysenteron""><i>B. chrysenteron</i></a> are in photo 3.</p>","University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz Co., California, USA",36.9904,-122.059,"","","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/3547453","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/4132495/medium.","leptonia",3547453,"Xerocomellus","Fungi",416305,3,0,"2009-11-13","2009-11-13","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",1753,1753,"","","false",NA,"",5179,"2016-06-29 15:51:12 UTC","2020-07-10 18:12:05 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

It makes me realize how much of my time I often spend thinking about images and not the subjects of those images: what they look like <em>now</em>, in front of my eyes, how they're reacting, moving, changing.  In many ways the camera helps me slow down and look closer at the world, but I find it important to remember how it can also distract me from the world.

Of course, it's not like I go birding cameraless!  Perish the thought.
