Many with various amounts of the pinkish red, from full pink-red to fading pink, to just dull yellow with pink highlights were found, usually all interspersed under live oak.  I present only a few example photos here.  This seems to he behavior of this species from Theirs, that it comes up reddish, goes pinkish, and ages to dull yellow.</p>
<p>The taste of all of these is the same, no matter the age.  Mild at first, and taking 5-10sec to build up to fully acrid.  I tasted a dozen or so samples checking out the various forms here, and my tongue was buzzing for the rest of the night.</p>
<p>With the rain, you would be tempted to say this is just R. silvicola that is getting washed out.  I don&#8217;t know, R. silvicola (form of R. cremoricolor) has a rapidly acrid taste, and more acrid than these.  Also when the color washes out of R. silvicola I think I&#8217;ve seen it as different.  Also these are well described as a separate species in Theirs.  So, I&#8217;m going for it, until a Russula expert can set me straight here.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60648592","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/96992346/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60648592,"Russula simillima","Fungi",809384,0,0,"2007-02-25","2007-02-25","","UTC",703,703,"","","false",NA,"",734334,"2020-09-24 21:00:53 UTC","2020-09-24 21:00:59 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

The caps are differently shaped than most of the R. silvicola I find, more centrally depressed and upturned.  Also the color is more pink, with salmon-orange-pink tones.  The older caps, the color is fading away to a brown grey, with only the center pinkish/red/salmon-orange.</p>
<p>With the white gills, in Theirs this point to R. simillima.  The notes for that one says these could be confused with R. bicolor, and the notes for R. bicolor say that it fades to only red at the margin, where these are fading to only red at the center.  But in the discription for these it mentions that sometimes these end up darker in the disc, so I don&#8217;t know.  Also there is R. paxilloides which also fades as it ages.  But those are very acrid, and say were only discribed from oaks near Stanford.  But then again these are near Stanford and under oaks&#8230; so I don&#8217;t know.

(I&#8217;m getting to much into Russula details, if I am evaluting the intesity of the arcid taste&#8230;)).  These are fading with only the reddish tones at the margin of the disc.  Something like R. silvicola (R. cremoricolor) does develop yellow patches as it ages, or gets heavy rains.  But this is not patches, but a even fading to just the margin.  Plus the margin is a light pinkish/red perhaps orange/copper tones.  This seems to match the discription for R. bicolor.  Although the discription states the habitat as spruce forests in north costal regions, but also hardwood forests of the foothills.  Are the Santa Cruz mountains foothills? Maybe?  There is also the mysterious R. paxilliodes, which was only described from Stanford campus, which isn&#8217;t too far away, which will fade to red at the margin&#8230; so I don&#8217;t know.</p>

"Hysterangium","2007-02-04 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Ok, these are the weird find of the week.  I was kicking up small dirt humps among this one live oak roots, where I have found R. cyanoxantha buried (And where I did find one R. cyanoxantha near by).  But in one of the dirt humps, this small white ball popped up.  I cleaned up the hump, and found a bunch of these whitish balls.  They each have this one small &#8220;root&#8221;, and are kinda like a small two lobed potato.  They have a hard thick whitish skin, with an interior spore mass.  This points to the genus of Hymenogaster, with the small size and growth on live oak roots, this points to H. parksii, which was found in the notes for H. sublilacinus in Arora.  The ball seems to have this strange band across them, which I tried to show in the third photo.  The spore mass looks like a lot of squished gills radiating out from a central point on one end of the tuber, which I tried to show in the forth photo.</p>
<p>3/1/2008 &#8211; Update on this id, now using the Field guide to N.A. truffles.  This is a small field guide of hypogeous fungi, most of them not truffles at all.  It lists 90 species with photos, but a little frustrating to use.  But with the photos here these are clearly not Hymenogaster.  The off-white thick skim, and the radially wrinkled interior gets you to the genus Hysterangium.  The guide mentions a couple species of this genus, but they seem to be under pines, and most important they have a mild odor.  These were found under live oak, and were intensely odored, very funky and stong.  That seems to be a better match for Trappea darkeri.</p>
