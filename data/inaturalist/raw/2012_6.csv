Crabo, Paul C. Hammond, Tomas Mustelin, David L. Wikle published on October 8, 2018.  Prior to the species being described, these specimen where most likely lumpted in with the very similar looking Dolocucullia dentilinea - Hodges#10188, but now D. poolei considered a separate species. 

As I understand it, The the strongly marked AM and PM lines that are joined, or nearly joined in the medial area of the forewing, as well as the boldness, and convex portion of the PM line as it extends toward the apex of the forewing seem to be distinctive features of D. poolei  See the description of the species, and accompanying images at:

"Dactylis glomerata","2012-06-14 17:54:00 -0700","Orchardgrass es una hierba perenne agresiva que está muy extendida en California. Crece en cualquier tipo de suelo, es resistente a la sequía y puede invadir algunas praderas. Orchardgrass es un pasto deseable, pero ha escapado de cultivos en muchas áreas naturales en todo Estados Unidos.
Puede invadir los bosques de roble y desplazar a los pastos nativos. Es una amenaza emergente en los pastizales costeros de pradera.
La vida silvestre se lo comerá.
Orchardgrass llegó con colonos europeos en el siglo XVIII.
Reconócelo:
Es una hierba de tallo delgado que crece de 18 a 4 pies de alto. Se desarrolla en grupos. Las hojas son azuladas, de media pulgada de ancho, planas y con una costilla blanca en el centro. Florece de mayo a agosto, flores amarillas en un grupo compacto. De dos a cuatro racimos estarán en una rama, cerca de la punta.
La rama más baja se separa como el espolón en el pie de un gallo, por lo que a veces se llama Pie de Gallo.
Controlarlo:
Las hierbas de racimo se pueden tirar con la mano. En áreas extensas, el glifosato es efectivo.

"Dactylis glomerata","2012-06-14 17:54:14 -0700","Orchardgrass is an aggressive perennial grass that is widespread in California. It grows in any type of soil, is drought resistant, and can overrun-some grasslands. Orchardgrass is a desirable pasture grass but has escaped cultivation in many natural areas throughout the United States. 
It can invade oak woodlands and displace native grasses. It is an emerging threat in coastal prairie grasslands.
Wildlife will eat it.
Orchardgrass arrived with European settlers in the 1700s.
Recognize it:
It’s a thin-stemmed grass that grows 18 inches to 4 feet tall. It develops in clumps. The leaves are bluish, half an inch wide, flat with a white rib down the middle. It blooms from May through August, yellow flowers in a compact cluster.  Two to four clusters will be on a branch, near the tip.
The lowest branch separates like the spur on a rooster’s foot, so it’s sometimes called Cock’s Foot.
Control it:
Bunch grasses can be hand pulled. Over wide areas, glyphosate is effective.

"Geococcyx californianus","2012-06-06 09:32:21 -0500","In Santee CA San Diego, at the end of Cuyamaca Street. June 2012. I've never seen a roadrunner in Santee before. Was a treat to see, haven't seen one in years. It made some calls.

I looked up roadrunners, and they're part of the cuckoo family. Roadrunner eggs have been found in raven and mockingbird nests. They are monogamous. The males bring the females building materials and the females build the nests. They share in incubating the eggs and feeding the hatchlings.

They are omnivorous, and bugs are a large part of their diet. While they'll eat fruit and what not when it comes around, they mainly are hunters. They kill larger animals like lizards by holding on to them and smashing them on the ground real hard like. They will kill and eat rattlesnakes and tarantula hawk wasps. 

They're not currently endangered, the chief challenges to them being habitat destruction and people shooting them for fun. Local extirpation occurs. Human development can be useful for them when it clears out areas of habitat to make it the opener terrain they prefer.","Foster, California, United States",32.868805,-116.980855,"","Greater Roadrunner","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/1571846","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/1945112/medium.jpg","anudderusername",1571846,"Greater Roadrunner","Aves",1986,4,0,"2012-06-06 09:32:21","2012-06-06","2012-06-06 14:32:21 UTC","Central Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","open","false","","",56265,"2015-06-01 10:14:25 UTC","2022-05-06 08:02:40 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

It would occasionally come to a stop, its head raised above the trimmed yellow grass like a periscope. Then it would resume its journey, zipping through the grass like wet lightning.

I noticed the tip of its tail was gone and had healed over into a nub - maybe the result of a battle with a small mammal or bird of prey. The picture shown is from a video I shot which is a bit grainy and jittery, but it gives you a pretty good idea of how fast these critters move. Wow!

Its leaves are attached to the stalk by petioles (many other Nicotiana species have sessile leaves), and its leaves and stems are neither pubescent nor sticky like Nicotiana tabacum. It grows to heights of more than two meters. Tree tobacco is native to South America but it is now widespread as an introduced species on other continents. It is a common roadside weed in the southwestern United States, and an invasive plant species in California native plant habitats.
 The plant is used for a variety of medicinal purposes and smoked by Native American groups.

LOCAL: Arnold, California

WHERE: Hiding under a rock, in a larger pile of similar sized stones. Forested residential area.

ELEVATION: 4500' ASL

Found by a curious 7 year old who loves to look for lizards, snakes, and other small life. No other snakes or signs of snakes seen, looked for eggs, didn't find any.

Very unaggressive and curious animal. It didn't mind being gently handled. After about 15 minutes and a few pictures, it was put back in the rock pile.","Arnold, California",38.2554729,-120.3510307,"","Sharp-tailed Snake","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/102052","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/147662/medium.jpg","markcarlson",102052,"Sharp-tailed Snake","Reptilia",26916,3,0,"2012-06-30","2012-06-30","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",7725,7725,"","open","false","","",8227,"2012-07-16 17:34:21 UTC","2018-12-21 02:48:34 UTC","research","CC-BY-ND",NA,NA,"false"

It previously belonged to the family Asclepiadaceae, but this is now classified as the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family Apocynaceae. Asclepias species produce their seeds in follicles. The seeds, which are arranged in overlapping rows, have white silky filament-like hairs known as pappus, silk, or floss. The follicles ripen and split open and the seeds, each carried by several dried pappus, are blown by the wind. They have many different flower colorations.","Eaton canyon Altadena California",34.1790863279,-118.0970433354,"veliz87, mirsternaturalist","woollypod milkweed","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/101068","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/146286/medium.JPG","martinez04",101068,"Woollypod Milkweed","Plantae",58796,3,1,"2012-06-27","2012-06-27","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false","","",8014,"2012-07-12 21:58:11 UTC","2016-09-24 16:21:30 UTC","research","CC-BY",NA,NA,"false"

I hadn't even noticed this pair around our house until yesterday, so I thought it was strange that they were so agitated all of a sudden... unless they had a fledgling nearby.  And finally, in the late afternoon, a fledgling started calling.  It was hanging out in a salvia bush near our front porch.  Its wings and tail were very short, and it was incapable of flight.  I imagine it fledged very recently.  The parents were coming in to feed it every so often.  I can still hear the fledgling in the same location today, but I can no longer see it.

"Accipiter cooperii","2012-06-07 00:00:00 -0800","I first found this nest on April 23 when I visited the Villa Chanticleer to do some birding.  When I first arrived at the Villa, I heard some calls in the woodland on the steep slope behind the upper parking lot. The calls sounded a bit like low-pitched squeak toys. It wasn't the typical ""kek-kek-kek"" call of a Cooper's Hawk, but it was similar enough that I thought it might be one. 

As soon as I stepped into the woodland, a Cooper's Hawk landed in a nearby tree.  As I was maneuvering to see it (my view was blocked by the trunk of another tree), a second Cooper's Hawk flew in. They flew at each other and then perched in different trees. The first bird, a female subadult with vertical streaks (female based on events described below), started eating something; I could eventually tell that it was a small passerine when I saw a dainty pinkish/orangeish leg.  After a minute or so, the second bird (a male with adult plumage) came and very briefly hopped on the back of the female, but it seemed too brief for exchange of any bodily fluids. The male then flew to a few spots before semi-stealthily flying over to a nest, which it sat in for no more than 30 seconds or a minute. It then flew back down to the female. Copulation ensued for about 10 seconds, with the adult-plumaged bird on top of the sub-adult-plumaged bird. One of the birds called repeatedly during the act but I couldn't tell which bird was making the noise as neither bird was opening its beak. 

The male flew out of the area soon after. It seems that the female just stayed in the woodland, quietly hanging out. I never saw it go to the nest, but I heard it call several times - about 5 minutes after the male left, and then about 30 minutes later when a Pileated Woodpecker flew into the area and there was a brief skirmish between the two.

It took me awhile to figure out what the relationship between the two birds was because one of them had the immature plumage and the first interaction where they flew at each other seemed somewhat antagonistic. But I think the male probably brought food in for the female as some sort of courtship offering, and then the first copulation attempt just didn't work. However, it was pretty clear that copulation was happening after the male visited the nest. The Birds of North America account for Cooper's Hawks says that breeding by 1st-year birds is not uncommon. Aha.

I have visited the nest several times since then.  On May 4, there was nobody visible on the nest.  The female was on the nest on May 20 and June 7, presumably incubating eggs.  The pictures of the female on the nest are from June 7.  The third picture shows the habitat, with the nest circled in red.","Villa Chanticleer, Healdsburg, CA",38.6210187288,-122.8498587012,"Healdsburg, Sonoma County","Cooper's Hawk","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/90388","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/131836/medium.JPG","emilyheaton",90388,"Cooper's Hawk","Aves",5112,2,0,"2012-06-07","2012-06-07","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",19,19,"","open","false","","",1203,"2012-06-12 06:10:33 UTC","2020-05-03 06:42:29 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
"Toxostoma redivivum","2012-06-11 00:00:00 -0800","I've been trying to track down a California Thrasher in one of my Breeding Bird Atlas blocks since early last year. I heard one singing multiple times last year and knew in my heart that it was a thrasher. However, there were several mockingbirds present in the surrounding area, including one that was using the same patch of scrubby habitat. The habitat seemed OK for a thrasher, but not great, so I really wanted to see one before I put it on my species list. 

I finally saw one walking around on May 31. While I was visiting that area today (June 11), I was excited to see a thrasher walk out of a small thicket just 10-15 feet away from me. It proceeded to forage and eat whatever it was catching. ""Hmm, I guess it's not going to do anything interesting,"" I thought. But then I noticed it trying unsuccessfully to carry a forked stick. It disappeared behind a shed, and then I noticed a second thrasher about to disappear into the thicket with a few small sticks/twigs in its bill. The first thrasher then reappeared also carrying sticks/twigs. It, too, disappeared into the thicket of blackberry, wild grape, toyon, and young live oaks and valley oaks. I was able to see one of them carry nesting material into the thicket one more time, and then they flew off in a different direction and didn't come back while I was there.

I could tell where they were taking the nesting material (based on the sound of rustling) and it wasn't far from the road. I'm hoping I'll be able to hear the young calling in a month or so. How cool would that be! I love thrashers!  

If you look carefully in the first picture, you can see a short stick in the thrasher's bill.  The third picture shows the habitat in the general area.","Maybee Ln, Healdsburg, CA",38.6504184008,-122.8830081224,"Healdsburg, Sonoma County","California Thrasher","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/90385","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/131829/medium.JPG","emilyheaton",90385,"California Thrasher","Aves",14906,2,0,"2012-06-11","2012-06-11","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","open","false","","",1203,"2012-06-12 05:27:10 UTC","2016-06-22 20:46:35 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

The young were squealing, which seems to be typical for this species (they don't sound much like the various other woodpecker young that I've heard).  There was a moment of panic when a Cooper's Hawk flew into the area and chased after one of the adults, then perched near the granary tree (too bad I didn't have my spotting scope set up yet - damn!).  But after a minute or so, it left and the woodpeckers carried on with the task of feeding the nestlings.  I was interested to see them nesting in the same cavity as last year.  I've included a picture of the nest tree.  The nest cavity is near the top of the tree and is circled in white.","Healdsburg Ridge Open Space Preserve, Healdsburg, CA",38.6385887529,-122.8614257276,"Healdsburg, Sonoma County","Acorn Woodpecker","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/90182","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/131579/medium.JPG","emilyheaton",90182,"Acorn Woodpecker","Aves",18209,3,0,"2012-06-10","2012-06-10","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,NA,"open","false","","",1203,"2012-06-11 03:50:36 UTC","2017-07-03 15:16:01 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

"Pipilo maculatus","2012-06-09 00:00:00 -0800","
Yesterday I noticed an adult Spotted Towee (Pipilo maculatus)with three juveniles  in my backyard, about 4:00pm.  They were on the ground under the sunflower feeder and the adult was giving the offspring lessons in foraging. They crowded around the parent who was picking around leaves, but not using the familiar back- and- forth- with- the- feet style of finding insects. She finally led them under a nearby hedge and they followed closely. I didn’t have time to grab a camera and take photos, but there are some good shots of the juveniles on the web, and The Sibley Guide to Birds has a great illustration.  They would have been difficult to ID because they have a plain brown back, beige-spotted wings and beige and brown striped breasts.  No beautiful rufous sides yet!
 I have a wonderful habitat for birds…Coast live oaks hang over my yard, elderly overgrown hedges bisect the lot, which is fully fenced with worn boards.  Most important there are low growing shrubs into which smaller birds can flee if a predator is nearby.

"Anas platyrhynchos","2012-06-01 00:00:00 -0800","There were 4-5 Mallard females with ducklings at the Healdsburg wastewater treatment plant.  Two females had one duckling, one had three ducklings, one had eight, and there may have been one with two.  All of the young were pretty small and downy (gray-brown and yellow) except for the group of eight, which were a little older and may have had their juvenal plumage.  Most of the young were seen in a pond that has wooden baffles/walls and some vegetative cover on the shore.  However, one duckling and its mom were in a bigger, deeper pond that has no vegetative cover (just a black synthetic liner that covers the steep dike slope).  The females were generally keeping the young along the wood baffles, so they were hidden from view much of the time.  When I would move into a spot where I could see ducklings, the mom would generally shepherd them onto the other side of the baffle out of my view.  I also saw one take her young into some vegetative cover and then stand on the edge of the pond, keeping guard.  I've included pictures of two different broods.","Healdsburg wastewater treatment facility, Healdsburg, CA",38.5823542288,-122.8637552261,"Healdsburg, Sonoma County","Mallard","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/86191","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/125948/medium.JPG","emilyheaton",86191,"Mallard","Aves",6930,2,0,"2012-06-01","2012-06-01","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false","","",1203,"2012-06-03 00:31:00 UTC","2017-09-28 07:36:35 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

The birds were primarily floating with bills tucked in, but the pair was foraging in a separate area of the pond.

"Himantopus mexicanus","2012-06-01 00:00:00 -0800","There were 5 Black-necked Stilts at the Healdsburg wastewater treatment plant, primarily hanging out in and around a shallow pond with areas of exposed mud, dry shoreline, and a few patches of weedy vegetative cover.  When I arrived, they were foraging and flying around a bit.  However, when I started walking toward one of the patches of vegetative cover,  they started to get agitated (the calls of one seemed especially upset) and engaged in a sort of communal distraction-display behavior.  This consisted of some wing-flapping while sitting and standing, and false-incubation displays in which individuals would repeatedly sit (as though incubating) and then stand in a given spot.  The wing-flapping was somewhat like the broken-wing display that Killdeer do, but the acting wasn't as good.  The false-incubation displays were given on shore, in shallow water, and on a wood baffle in one of the ponds (the latter two locations were obviously no good for nesting).  One individual's false-incubation display was pretty convincing - it walked behind a clump of vegetation, then proceeded to sit with just its head peeking out from behind the grasses. After less than a minute, it stood and then sat again; this was repeated several times.  When I walked over to that location to see if there was a nest, all the commotion died down and the stilts seemed quite content that they had fooled me into going over there.  A few hours later, I walked past the same patch of vegetative cover and got the same response.  It's pretty clear that they're nesting in that area (distraction display counts as evidence for a confirmed breeding observation for the Sonoma County Breeding Bird Atlas).

I've posted two videos on YouTube that show the wing-flapping displays, for anyone who's curious to see them.  The quality is pretty bad because I lost the toilet paper tube that I attach to my spotting scope to take pictures (so high tech!).  They can be viewed at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnQAHOhCEIA and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2_OAgRe850.","Healdsburg wastewater treatment facility, Healdsburg, CA",38.5819491069,-122.8620614111,"Healdsburg, Sonoma County","Black-necked Stilt","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/86166","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/125912/medium.JPG","emilyheaton",86166,"Black-necked Stilt","Aves",4836,2,0,"2012-06-01","2012-06-01","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","open","false","","",1203,"2012-06-02 23:05:23 UTC","2016-06-22 20:41:59 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
