"Niebla ceruchoides","2018-03-11 22:09:00 -0700","Clumping Sea-Fog Lichen (Niebla ceruchoides), photographed on the railing of the old footbridge over the Stevens Creek Tidal Marsh in Mountain View, CA.  Identified as such, as follows:

1) I first uploaded the photo of the unidentified lichen to inaturalist.org, to see what inaturalist might suggest that this lichen could be.  
2) inaturalist's first two suggestions, based on visual similarity, turned out to be the Sandcastle Worm (Pragmatopa californica), which doesn't even remotely resemble this lichen, and the common coralline algae (Coralline officinalis), which sort of does, but isn't the sort of thing you'd expect to find on the dessicated railing of an old pedestrian footbridge.  The third suggestion was the Armored Sea-Fog Lichen (Niebla homalea), which was more in line with what I was expecting.
3) I studied pictues of Armored Sea-Fog Lichen on innaturalist and on the Consortium of North American Lichen Herbaria (CNALH) portal, and decided that Armored Sea-Fog Lichen wasn't the best fit for the lichen in my picture.  Although N. homalea has a branching structure that is similar, the ""branches"" are flattened and angular, not cylindrical as is the case for my mystery lichen.  Also, its habit is a bit more airy and open than that of my mystery lichen, which is compact, dense and prickly.
4)  Consulting with the CNALH portal and with Stephen Sarnoff's book, The Lichens of California, I found another Niebla species that seemed to fit my mystery lichen better: the Clumping Sea-Fog Lichen, Niebla ceruchoides.  According to CSNALH, here are the characteristics of N. ceruchoides, which mostly compare favorably with the lichen in my photo:

[4.1] Thallus is fruticose, dense, compact, and light green to yellow green in color, forming bush-like mats resembling a cushion plant or a bryophite.  [This aptly describes the lichen in my photo.  Its thallus is definitely fruticose, dense, and compact in character, with an overall color of light green.]
[4.2] Usually 1 to 3.5 cm high, less
commonly larger.  [The specimen in my photo is about 2 cm high.]
[4.3]  Densely branched branches, usually cylindrical (occasionally angular in some specimens), rigid and friable when dry, less than 1mm in diameter.  [The branches
on this specimen are clearly cylindrical and rigid (although I did not try to break any of them to see how ""friable"" they were).  The average diameter for these branches is definitely less than 1 mm.]
[4.4]  Surface of branches is smooth or weakly fasciated. [For the specimen in the photo, the branch surfaces are smooth.]
[4.5] Apothecia not common, up to 7mm wide, subtermimal but near branch tips, discs pale green and concave. [The specimen in the photograph does not have any apothecia at all.]
[4.6] Pycnidia: Black, immersed, often at branch tips.  [If you look carefully at the closeup photo, you see a few black pycnidia here and there, generally at the branch tips.  There aren't that many of them on this specimen, however.]
[4.7] Medulla: White, dense, lacking any strand-like hyphen adhesions. [I did not check this, because I did not want to damage or kill this lichen in any way.]
[4.8] Substrate and ecology:  Usually on rocks (but sometimes on soil) and cliffs on the immediate coast within the zone of coastal fog and breeze influence. [The substrate in the photo is an old and slowly decaying wooden railing, not rock, so the substrate could be a probelm with this identification.  The location is in a salt marsh that borders the salt ponds that now form the southern boundary of San Francisco Bay.  Although this location is not on the outer coast, it is ecologically similar, in that it is subject to the marine fog and sea breeze that come in off San Francisco Bay.)

Despite the possible issue with the underlying substrate (wood instead of rock), I am going to go with Clumping Sea-Fog (Niebla ceruchoides) as the identification for my mystery lichen...for now.  Note, however, that I am a newbie to lichens, so I consider all of my lichen identifications to be highly tentative.  It is entirely possible that I may have overlooked an even better candidate genus/species of lichen.

Also note:  There are two photographs in the set.  The first photograph is a closeup of the lichen itself, while the second shows the lichen in situ with other lichen species on the bridge railing.","Stevens Creek Tidal Marsh, Santa Clara County, CA",37.4305453955,-122.0691870153,"Clumping Sea-Fog Lichen, Mountain View, Niebla ceruchoides, Santa Clara County, Stevens Creek Tidal Marsh","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/10682984","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/14915938/medium.jpg","arnel",10682984,"Niebla ceruchoides","Fungi",117846,0,0,"2018/03/11 10:09 PM PDT","2018-03-11","2018-03-12 05:09:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",6,6,"","","false","","",29323,"2018-04-07 18:23:16 UTC","2019-11-24 17:54:29 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

"Amsinckia menziesii intermedia","2018-03-11 22:54:00 -0700","Rancher's Fiddlenecks (Amsinckia intermedia), photographed in the Overflow Parking Area at Shoreline Park in Mountain View, CA.  Identified as such baed on the following (per Jepson's eFlora):

1) First, I noticed that none of the sepals are markedly different in size or shape from the others.  This characteristics eliminates have of the possible species listed in Jepson's under Amsinckia.
2) Next, I noted that the leaves of this plant were neither toothed nor succulent (the latter by feeling the laaves).  This eliminated Amsinckia spectabilis and its subspecies. 
3) I then noted that the corolla of its flowers were radial in symmetry, not bilateral.  This eliminated A. lunaris from consideration.
4) The throat of its corolla is open (not constricted or closed-off in any way) and glabroud (no hairs).  This elomomates A. lycopsoides.
5) The diameter of the corolla is around 6 mm, with style not exserted from the corolla tube.  This eliminnates A. eastwoodiae, whose corolla diameter is typically twice that size.
6)  The orange corolla eliminates A. retorsa, whose flower corollas are yellow.  THis leaves us with two possibilities:  A. intermedia and A. menziesii.  
6) In this case, the diameter of the corolla can't be used to distinguish between A. ntemedia and A. menziesii, because the 6 mm corolla diameter of the  flowers in the photograph falls within range for both species.  Howeer, the length of the corolla tube ~8mm - 10 mm, which is consistent for A. intermedia.  Also, the corolla tube is mostly exserted from the calyx (though the bottom part of it remains inside the calyx to keep the flower attached to the plant).  Again, this is consistent with A. intermedia.

Final note:  At the time that this photograph was taken (mid to late March), the plant had no seeds to examine, so I had to bypass the seed descriptions in Jepson's for this identification.  It isn't ideal, but it did work itself out.","Shoreline Park, Mountain View, CA",37.430211,-122.072568,"Amsinckia intermedia, Mountai View, Rancher's FIddlenecks, Rank 2, Santa Clara County, Shoreline Park","Rancher's fiddleneck","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/10547689","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/14688986/medium.jpg","arnel",10547689,"Rancher's fiddleneck","Plantae",49141,1,0,"2018/03/11 10:54 PM PDT","2018-03-11","2018-03-12 05:54:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",52,52,"","","false","","",29323,"2018-04-01 15:57:04 UTC","2018-08-21 08:16:47 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

There are three photographs in the set, showing the fly from different angles.  As I am by no means an expert on Syrphid Flies, I consider my identification of this fly to be tentative. I arrived at this identification as described below:

First, I uploaded the photo of this insect to inaturalist, and inaturalist gave me several possible identifications.  After throwing out several obviously wrong identifications such as Western Honey Bee, I was left with the Eristalinus-type Syrphid Flies as the best possible candidates for the fly in this photo.  Some flies in the genus Eristalinus are known to have exotically-patterned eyes, so this seemed like a good avenue to explore.

Next, I conducted more research on the genus Eristalinus using bugguide.net and diptera.info.  Eventually, I found one species that seemed to fit this fly's characteristics closely:  Eristalinus aeneus. From the pictures of E. aeneus on bugguide.net, it was obvious that E. aeneus has the same oversized eyes as the fly in the photo, with the same exotic pattern of dots across the surface of each eye.  It also has the same paddle-like antenna projecting out from its forehead, with tiny hairs called arista emanating from each ""paddle.""  Its legs are banded with black and white patches, its thorax is black with white vertical stripes, and its abdomen is bronze and rather shiny - all consistent with the fly in this photograph.

Finally, I checked the photographs that I took of this fly and tried to study the details of the wing venation.  Unfortunately,  I wasn't able to capture these details with any real clarity in any of the photographs.  Even so, I think that the visual similarity of Eristalinus aeneus with the fly in this photo is such that it seems to be a reasonably safe identification to make.

Eristalinus aeneus was originally a European species that has now become widely established in North America.  I found this individual pollinating the flowers of a rosemary bush along the side of a pumping station near the Stevens Creek Tidal Marsh.

Also known as the Painted Bug, this insect originates from Africa, and has recently arrived in our area by way of Southern California.  It has become an agricultural pest wiht a strong preference for members of the mustard family, which includes the Shortpod Mustard (Hirshcfeldia incana), where I found this pair happily copulating. 

Bagrada bugs are in the same family as stink bugs and shield bugs (Pentatomidae), and so they share that family's trapezoidal body shape, as well as its distinctive forewings (hemelytra).  The forewings are distinctive because they are thick only at the base, becoming membranous towards the apex.

"Fumaria muralis","2018-03-11 22:17:00 -0700","Common Ramping-Fumitory (Fumaria muralis), photographed at the Stevens Creek Tidal Marsh near Mountain View, CA.  This annual herbaceous forb is a recent import from Europe, so that one cannot find it keyed out in Jepson's eFlora yet.  It has tiny, pinnately dissected, cauline leaves, which lack any hairs, spines, or other defenses.  Its flowers appear in terminal inflorescences, with each flower consisting of two sepals (which fall off when the flower opens) and four purplish petals.  The petals themselves form long, tight, tube-like corollas that conceal a single style and two sets of anthers.  The outer petals are unequal in size (the bottom one being noticeably smaller and thinner than the upper one), with the upper petal also bearing a spur (not really obvious in this photo).  The petals are pinkish to purple throughout, with a pronounced purplish spot at each of the petals' tips. 

Its larger, longer petals distinguish it from Common Fumitory (Fumaria officinalis) and Fine-leaved Fumitory (Fumaria parviflora), both of which have been established in California for some time.  Its pink-and-purple or completely purple coloration distinguishes it from the White Ramping-Fumitory (Fumaria capreolata), another European transplant that has arrived in California more recently, which has white petals with purple on the tips only.

This pair had similar markings - darkish bodies with strongly patterned sides, back and lower wind edges - white, brown and black banded over coppery tan. Heads showed the characteristic unfeathered snood in bluish grey, with a red featherless wattle and patch across the forehead.  Unfortunately I startled them in my car and couldn't get a good image of their breasts.  
Birds are very large, this pair was at least 3' tall and heavy bodied.

"Quercus lobata","2018-03-11 00:00:00 -0800","This large, somewhat unhealthy looking tree clung to the edge of a steep embankment leading down to the river.  It was tall with drooping irregularly placed branches.  The branches still held some clusters of dried brown leaves from last season. 
Leaves were deeply lobed, 2-4"" long.  The bark showed the characteristic thick, ridged pewter colored bark of valley oaks.  

The tree was beginning to bloom on all branches evidenced by the presence of fuzzy greenish yellow buds (that will eventually become catkins).

Valley Oak is an endemic species

This goose walked boldly and heavily around the boat ramp parking lot and appeared to be comfortable in presence of people and leashed dogs.
