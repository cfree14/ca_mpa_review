<p>Looking at various keys for Inocybe, I seem to get a different species from each one.  The encrusted cystidia are important, and the smooth spores.  Champignons de Suisse doesn&#8217;t have a good one for this, Funga Nordica kinda id&#8217;s as Inocybe langei, but they don&#8217;t mention the veil tissue on the disc.  The Inocybe key to the NW, by Oluna Ceska kinda id&#8217;s to Inocybe ochroalba.  But then comparing to Funga Nordica for that one, the cystidia should be short and rounded, so that isn&#8217;t good.  The best id from the &#8220;Inocybe key to CA&#8221;, Nishida, seems to be Inocybe kauffmanii, and I can&#8217;t find another source to say it isn&#8217;t that&#8230; so I&#8217;ll go with that id.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60688833","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97061512/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60688833,"Inocybe kauffmanii","Fungi",518865,0,0,"2011-01-16","2011-01-16","","UTC",703,703,"","","false",NA,NA,734334,"2020-09-25 06:23:01 UTC","2020-09-25 06:23:10 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

"Hydnellum chrysinum","2011-01-21 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Found under pine.</p>
<p>The micro-shots are of a spine at 1000x in KOH.  The basidia are long, narrow, 4-spored with long sterimata.  No clamp connections were obs.  The spores are ellipsiod, warted/nodulose.

<p>The micro-shots kinda came out out of focus, unfortunately.  And there weren&#8217;t a lot of spores from the spine there.  But there are enough to get an accurate enough spore size.  It seems that pretty much all Hydnellums have about the same size spores, except for this one.  H. chrysinum has consistently significantly smaller spores.  The spore size here, and the colors, with the orange to brown spines, match the descriptions for H. chrysinum.  Except that this species was named from Nova Scotia in Canada, and is known under hardwoods in the east coast.  Here it is under pines in California.</p>

"Ramaria rubricarnata verna","2011-01-16 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Found under live oak.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t seen a Ramaria here for many years, and this time a big group of them.  Going with id with the pinkish orange branches and the bright yellow tips, and the large conjoined base.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of a branch end at 1000x in KOH.  The basidia here are clamped.  Ok, not the best shot, but it is there, if I get to it, I should circle the clamped basidia.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of spores from the branch at 1000x in KOH.  The spores are long, cylidrical, with a rounded end, and warted.  The measured average size of the spores is length &#8211; 11.67 +/- 0.78 (err 0.30) um, width &#8211; 4.58 +/- 0.23 um (err: 0.12) &#8211; q : 2.55 +/- 0.11, on 7 spores.</p>
<p>This was the first time I saw the clamp con. on the basidia for a Ramaria.  Once I could see it, it wasn&#8217;t hard.  But usually with Ramaria the basidia stay all tightly clumped no matter how hard I squash it.  The problem isn&#8217;t seeing the clamps, as much as it seems to be the ability to easily separate the basidia in the mount.  But with the clamps, and the colors, and esp. the width of the spores, as only 4.6 um, this comes out at Ramaria rubricarnata var. verna in the Pacific NW Ramaria book.  The only problem is in the season, since this is winter here, and the species is supposed to be seen in spring.  And the habitat, where it is under pines in the Pacific NW, and is under live oaks here.<br />
But everything else matches exactly, so I&#8217;m going with the id.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60688259","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97060681/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60688259,"Ramaria rubricarnata var. verna","Fungi",204729,0,0,"2011-01-16","2011-01-16","","UTC",703,703,"","","false",NA,NA,734334,"2020-09-25 06:07:43 UTC","2020-09-25 06:07:50 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

<p>Adding some micro-details&#8230;</p>
<p>The first and second micro-shots are of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The cheilocystidia are slightly mixed, with some inflated and rounded on the ends, some cylidrical, some inflated at the base, to thickened in the middle.  Also no pleurocystidia are obs.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of the spores from the gill at 1000x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The spores are ellipsoid, pointed, with roughened perispore that doesn&#8217;t loosen, and they are non-dextrinoid.  The apr. ave. size is 11 &#215; 6.5 um.</p>
<p>Ok, from here this gets a little subtle, and takes detailed reading of &#8220;The Genus Hebeloma&#8221; by Jan Vesterholt.  But he makes a big deal about the inflated middles and bases of cheilocystidia, that is an important feature of a few species.  This one has a mixture of inflated and non-inflated cystidia, and that mixture is important for a few species.  Then we get to the non-dextinoid spores, and this points to Hebeloma hiemale.  Along with that, the growth under oaks, and the qualities of the stipe all agree, so this seems to be a pretty good id, with the descriptions in that book.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60688085","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97060394/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60688085,"Hebeloma hiemale","Fungi",382536,0,0,"2011-01-16","2011-01-16","","UTC",703,703,"","","false",NA,NA,734334,"2020-09-25 06:01:56 UTC","2020-09-25 06:02:08 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

"Puma concolor","2011-01-13 00:00:00 -0800","My friend Stewart and I were out driving on Mines Road doing some of our usual sight seeing on a kinda rainy day. We had never been on the road and were curious to where it went and what or whom lived out that way.  We had been seeing a ton of frogs, toads, salamanders and newts that day. Also a fair share of raptors in various sections of the road, but they all paled in comparison to what we would witness later that day. My buddy and I had just taken some photos of our 10,000th newt for the day, got back in the car and were on our way when Stewart yells in a broken manner ""B-B-B-l-ood, s-s-stop-p-p-p da CAR!"" I'm freaking out thinking Oh my God did I hit someone, is the car on fire, but then he is able to blurt out ""M-m-m-mountain LION!, STOP DA CAR!"" Sure enough we look over at this little goat farm where there was pen full of goats running around in a crazed manner. Then out of their bustle materializes this mountain lion. Mouth covered with blood and belly looking incredibly full.  Luckily, I was able to snap off one picture before it bounded over the fence and up into the woods. Of course my camera was set to some strange setting and I got a horrible picture but none-the-less we were juiced. MOUNTAIN LION BLOOD!
