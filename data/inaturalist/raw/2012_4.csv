"Calypte anna","2012-04-12 00:00:00 -0800","I first found this Anna's Hummingbird nest on March 29 when I heard the female buzz above my head and then saw it fly up to sit on a nest in a leafless blue(?) oak.  At some point, the female left and later returned with a small feather, which it quickly worked into the rim of the nest.  On April 7, the female was sitting on the nest when I first arrived.  She came and went a few times.  I believe she sat on the nest for awhile each time she visited, but I didn't record the details in my notebook.  One time she seemed to be working something into the rim of the nest.  When I arrived on April 12, the female was again sitting on the nest.  She left a few times and returned.  She was either working something into the nest (I didn’t see her bring in any nest material) or feeding very small young.  I suspected the latter.  It had been raining in recent days so it would make sense if she was brooding the young in between feedings.  I checked the nest again on May 2, but it looked like the nest had been predated.  The feathers in the cup were visible and looked like they had been loosened.

The nest was covered in lichen and expertly camouflaged.  It looked very similar to another Anna's Hummingbird nest that I found in an oak last year.  The nest was on a limb overhanging Westside Trail.

The first two pictures were taken on April 12, and the other two were taken on April 7.

Because sea otters tend not to haul out during the daytime in this area, I was a bit concerned, so I watched it for awhile, finally concluding that it was OK, just chilling out.

"Lophodytes cucullatus","2012-04-22 00:00:00 -0800","My husband and I did a 1-night backpacking trip at Lake Sonoma and camped at Old Sawmill Camp on the Warm Springs Arm. On the morning of April 22, 2012, I heard a strange guttural croaking call coming from the lake so I went down to check it out. I was excited to find a male Hooded Merganser floating on the lake. It soon took off and flew up the lake. Two female mergansers then flew into the area and landed, but I am fairly certain they were Common Mergansers.

The call that I heard sounded just like the ""male display"" call that's available on the Hooded Merganser page for Cornell's All About Birds (http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Hooded_Merganser/sounds). The call is described as the ""craaa-crrrooooo"" call in Birds of North America online (although I don't think that's a very good description; it sounded more like ""be-boooooow"" (as in bow-wow) to me, but it's the same call (I listened to the ""craaa-crrrooooo"" audio associated with the BNA account)).  Birds of North America says that Hooded Mergansers are ""typically silent. Vocalizations most commonly heard during courtship and around nest sites. Male produces a rolling frog-like craaa-crrrooooo.""  BNA also mentions a hollow pop, which I heard as well.

I wonder if this Hooded Merganser was thinking about nesting in Sonoma County; or it may have just been starting courtship behavior before arriving on its nesting grounds. The habitat around Old Sawmill Camp is definitely suitable, but as far as I know (and I've talked to someone who's pretty knowledgeable about these things), there are no breeding records for Hooded Mergansers in Sonoma County.  Old Sawmill Camp is near the upper end of the Warm Springs Arm and the lake is pretty narrow there (<50m across).  The lake was full at the time.

Snatched it up and brought it up the hill a bit to show my buddies. They were amazed, but I spied a group of young teenagers in a group of cars nearby smoking and necking and doing things that young teens do. I walked up to them and asked ""Hey, guys do you wanna see somethin' cool?""

""Yeah, what is it?""

""This snake!""  

The looks and reactions were priceless, but once everyone calmed down it turned into a bit of a naturalist interpretive moment. Almost all of the kids were totally unware that there were snakes living so close to their homes. The snake was returned to it's rightful home under the garbage heap and teenagers learned about snakes and to exercise a caution when encountering a stranger asking them if they want to see something cool.

"Dendragapus fuliginosus","2012-04-28 00:00:00 -0800","I heard a Sooty Grouse booming on the morning of 4/28/2012 while out backpacking on Cooley Ranch, a private ranch on the border of Sonoma and Mendocino counties.  I decided to try to find it.  This meant climbing a ridiculously steep ranch road, so I decided to leave my spotting scope back at camp.  However, I was very grateful for the steep ranch road, as it led me straight to the grouse.  It did take some effort to find it, but I was eventually able to see a male grouse about 30 feet up in a Douglas-fir.  I could see the beautiful yellow comb over its eye and a yellow air sac, and I could see its chest pump as it boomed (a soft ""whoof, whoof, whoof, whoof, whoof, whoof""); the tail was partially fanned.  It was so cool!!  I wasn't able to get a good picture because I had no spotting scope, but I did get a video that captured the booming.  It's available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NLb_PrL5cI.  Hopefully, that will be enough for a research-grade id.

Interestingly, the habitat in the surrounding landscape was primarily oak woodland/hardwood forest with some Douglas-fir mixed in; as well as some patches of grassland.  In the immediate area, the habitat was composed of black oak, madrone, and Douglas-fir.  I've posted a picture of the habitat it was in.  Other birds heard in the area were Acorn Woodpecker, Oak Titmouse, European Starling, Mountain Quail, California Quail, and American Kestrel - not the species I'd expect to see a Sooty Grouse hanging out with.  The bird was booming on a northwest-facing slope, approximately 400 feet above the canyon below.

Cooley Ranch is privately owned but can sometimes be accessed through events/hikes led by LandPaths, the group that organized the backpacking trip that I was on.

"Taxidea taxus","2012-04-15 00:00:00 -0800","Badger adult female was observed through binoculars at burrow entrance, playing with two large young. Female would ascend large mound of fresh earth on an already steep slope, then young would push her back down. This activity repeated over a period of nearly 15 min. from 4:45-5PM while burrow area was in full but gentle sunlight. On some occasions one or more individuals would somersault down the slope before resuming the game. After the initial 15 min. of play the adult moved downslope making many small digs most likely for voles (see Elbroch & Rinehart 2011, Behavior of N. Am. Mammals). Young retired to burrow at this point as female worked down slope until she disappeared into a brushy gully.
Burrow site is visible from Highway 35 (Skyline Blvd.) at milepost SMC 8.36, looking west. Returned on 4/16 at same hour with Logan Rosenberg. Family had relocated 2 hillsides farther away but were once again lounging at a burrow entrance, although not as active, and almost too far to identify. Photos show closer of 2 burrow locations at center of image (largest mound). Female and 1 young can be detected by enlarging image (female at lower edge of mound.)","Windy Hill Open Space Preserve, San Mateo Co., CA",37.3621077012,-122.2486495971,"Badger, den, Taxidea taxus","American Badger","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/67671","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/102793/medium.jpg","garth_harwood",67671,"American Badger","Mammalia",41789,3,0,"2012-04-15","2012-04-15","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","open","false","","",2527,"2012-04-19 16:55:23 UTC","2020-05-25 20:50:10 UTC","research","CC-BY",NA,NA,"false"

Thunder is good, thunder is impressive; but it is lightning that does the work.

--Mark Twain


For me, a landscape does not exist in its own right, since its appearance changes at every moment; but the surrounding atmosphere brings it to life - the light and the air which vary continually. For me, it is only the surrounding atmosphere which gives subjects their true value. 	
	--Claude Monet


A poet is someone who stands outside in the rain hoping to be struck by lightning.

"Calypte anna","2012-04-12 17:14:18 -0700","This humming bird was seen in my backyard. We like to keep our two humming bird feeders up high. The feeders are also located next to a purplish plant you see in the background of one of the pictures. I have seen the hummingbirds drink from those flowers as well, but only when they are in full bloom. I believe this hummingbird is a female Annas hummingbird. (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong), because of its slightly greenish back, and whitish-grey belly. I have seen other ones with pink under their chins, which I believe are the males but I couldn't get a picture of them because they were too quick. This is the only one of them that let me get close enough. I have seen these birds chase each other away from the feeders and guard it. But the others always seem to come back. Luckily we have two feeders, so while one is being protected, the other one is free to drink from.","38.453956604003906, -122.65974426269531",38.453956604,-122.6597442627,"Anna Hummingbird","Anna's Hummingbird","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/64998","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/99325/medium.jpg","rowlands_courtney_3",64998,"Anna's Hummingbird","Aves",6317,3,0,"April 12, 2012 5:14:18 PM PDT","2012-04-12","2012-04-13 00:14:18 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",100,100,"","open","false","","",5911,"2012-04-13 00:42:59 UTC","2017-09-29 07:39:38 UTC","research","CC-BY",NA,NA,"false"

"Homo sapiens","2012-04-07 00:00:00 -0800","It was my first time visiting Santa Barbara and I can say that I was very impressed by the city. I witnessed a very lively town full of interesting things to do, eat, and enjoi. A mix of residents and college students the town has a very interesting ""college town"" dynamic. Seen plenty of party buses amidst families eating ice cream at McConnell's.  One place that was highly recommend to me was the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. Arriving at the museum we were greeted by a very large articulated skeleton of a blue whale affectionately known as ""Chad."" That skeleton alone did it for me, but upon actually entering the museum for a reasonable fare the amazement continued. Their entomological, animal, bird halls were all very nice and informative.  Especially the entomological display of local bug life that greets you as you walk through the hall's door. The children's area was also very cool. We were told that the display was temporary, but for being temporary it was still very thoughtful and offered a couple of very unique displays. My favorite was out back of the museum by their nature trails there was a mock dinosaur fossil in a sandbox were visitors young and old could pretend to be paleontologists uncovering velociraptor at a dig site.  The gift shop too was also well done offering books, toys, collectables, and resources for children, amateur naturalists, teachers and other educators alike.   I'm not sure if I saw all that the museum had to offer, but my family and I very much enjoyed ourselves and would like to thank the staff for creating such a inviting, informative, creative and pleasurable learning environment. Anyone visiting the area should definitely make the passage to this museum.    http://www.sbnature.org/    ","Santa Barbara County, US-CA, US",34.5148530375,-119.7596191482,"Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, Blue whale Chad","Human","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/64473","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/98789/medium.JPG","greenrosettas",64473,"Human","Mammalia",43584,5,0,"2012-04-07","2012-04-07","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,28818,"","obscured","true","","",3161,"2012-04-11 21:16:08 UTC","2020-09-21 00:48:37 UTC","casual","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"true"

"Quercus agrifolia","2012-04-03 00:00:00 -0800","I love old big trees and find the hidden history found in their roots amazing. Leona Heights Park is the site of an old Redwood forest that was cut down numerous times. Also was the site of an iron pyrite which provided raw ore to the Leona Chemical Company. Finding a large old oak tree like this that escaped the loggers saw and still lives today is very curious to me. I'll have to go back and measure its diameter. I enjoy reading about history and I often run across historians making the remark, ""All of a Oakland's oaks were cut down.""  I do believe that most were lost, but I still think that there are a couple old oaks and redwoods that linger on in those hills.
