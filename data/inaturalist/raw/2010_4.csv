Unlike other birds, about 40% of American Avocets don't just fly a short distance and drop the shells.  Instead, they carry it some distance from their nest, and swirl it around in the water, as if washing the eggshell, and then drop it in deep water away from their nest.

For decades there was a birdbath located at Cabrillo NM and it acted as a migrant trap for birds.  For some reason the administration decided to remove it and it is no longer there.

In essence, the administration at Cabrillo told birders that they were no longer welcome at the sight.","Cabrillo NM--The drip",32.6735304,-117.2412564,"","Lesser Goldfinch","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/225147","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/283489/medium.jpg","finatic",225147,"Lesser Goldfinch","Aves",145308,2,0,"2010-04-11 09:47:54","2010-04-11","2010-04-11 16:47:54 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,NA,"open","false",NA,"",10285,"2013-03-29 17:59:33 UTC","2021-01-13 19:04:24 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
