Just before we entered this wilderness area, I looked up while Hubby was checking our map, and saw this majestic bighorn sheep on a ledge above our heads. It posed there, then sprinted down to the river for a drink before crossing it and bolting up the opposite bank.

"Athene cunicularia","2009-07-03 00:00:00 -0800","On July 3, 2009, my husband and I observed three Burrowing Owls in Bear Valley, Colusa County. We saw them along a section of Bear Valley Rd that runs east-west, 11 miles from Hwy 20. The owls were hanging out along a dry creek that runs parallel to the road, primarily perching on a fence that runs between the road and the creek. We weren't able to tell if any were juveniles (though we weren't trying very hard - it was getting late and we were on our way to Snow Mountain Wilderness), but I'd imagine the presence of three individuals in early July indicates likely breeding.

I was able to find a post on the central_valley_birds Yahoo! group that reported a Burrowing Owl in what seems to be the same location on Feb 28, 2008. I was not able to find any reports of summer sightings in Bear Valley. The map of current breeding range in the California Bird Species of Special Concern book (published in 2008 by the Western Field Ornithologists and CDFG) does not quite include Bear Valley. However, the expansive grassland populated by ground squirrels provides suitable breeding habitat, so it would not be surprising if Burrowing Owls breed here.  Bear Valley is fairly remote, so it's not visited by birders very often. 

Sorry, no pictures.  This was back in the days when I never bothered to take pictures of things.  After I reported the sighting to central_valley_birds, someone else went out there and reported seeing one Burrowing Owl on July 10, 2009, in the same location.","Bear Valley Rd, Colusa County, CA",39.1230772988,-122.4303746223,"Bear Valley, Colusa County","Burrowing Owl","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/91367","","emilyheaton",91367,"Burrowing Owl","Aves",19975,0,0,"2009-07-03","2009-07-03","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",103,103,"","open","false",NA,"",1203,"2012-06-15 02:38:45 UTC","2016-06-22 20:48:17 UTC","casual","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
