"Eriophyes lepidosparti","2018-03-30 16:37:00 -0700","Suspected midge gall, is apparently a mite.

""Bud gall caused by Eriophyes lepidosparti (Keifer) (pi. 33)
The mites attack the buds and inhibit elongation of the shoot;
the result is a visible configuration of the affected structure
somewhat similar to a rosette. There is considerable crowding
and bunching together of malformed, stunted, thickened
shoots and aborted buds with short outgrowths.
This wormlike, pinkish mite measures 170-180 microns long.
The featherclaws are 5-rayed; the dorsal shield has numerous
short, weak lines scattered at the middle and enclosed by 2
longitudinal, parallel ridges; the hysterosoma is completely
covered with rounded microtubercles; the coxae are abundantly
granular; and the coverflap of the female genitaha has
14 radiating ribs. This last characteristic is particularly distinctive.
The mites inhabit the buds. They were found in June on
Lepidospartum squamatum, a rigid broomlike shrub common
in washes and gravelly places in California.

Reference: Keifer, 1951: 95.""
