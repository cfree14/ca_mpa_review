A story about another observation that I don't have any footage from. This was about the year I was down at the Hyatt beach around 3am on a different night. I had an amazing experience. I observed a black bear walk along the east side of Lone Eagle Grill (before it was all gated off), all the way out on the Hyatt pier, climb down into the water, swim around playing out in the moonlit water. It was maybe fishing off the pier too because I have seen some large fish off the pier at night. It swam all the way across the buoy line distance over to the other side of the beach near where Incline Creek comes out. The experience lasted about an hour or so. What amazing imagery to imagine a time when wildlife like this had easy access to the lake.
It's upsetting that the Hyatt continually blocks off more access to the wildlife and locals with more gates, walls, and fences over their greed. More recently building that eye sore of a beach bar. What was once a beautiful open beach from a fire pit is now a development.

This dumpster and bakery just inside those doors was a problem for years. I wouldn't doubt that it still is. I had researched and proposed to them to install an automatic sliding door that was set to a timer to switch to manual operation at night. No different than grocery stores. It would have saved them a lot of money on air conditioning, heating, bears walking into the bakery and made it easier on employees. They ignored my proposal though.","Incline Village, NV 89451, USA",39.2400292978,-119.9441250512,"","American Black Bear","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/96040272","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/159511706/medium.jpg","ipomopsis",96040272,"American Black Bear","Mammalia",41638,1,0,"2008/11/17 12:37 AM PST","2008-11-17","2008-11-17 08:37:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",2,2,"","open","false",NA,NA,3719723,"2021-09-25 03:12:13 UTC","2022-03-06 03:25:38 UTC","research","",NA,NA,"false"

"Clitopilus hobsonii","2008-11-16 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Found on a well decayed log.</p>
<p>More of these small unknown Crepidotus found up there in a damp seepage area.  I left these out overnight, until the gills became tan, to make sure I could get some spores.  Maybe I&#8217;ll be able to get a species on these this time.</p>
<p>Ok, this one has been bothering me for awhile, about a year and half or so&#8230;</p>
<p>But these are small, and pure white, sessile on wood, and just looks like yet another Crepidotus.  But it was kinda funny under the scope.</p>
<p>The micro-shot is of spores from the gill at 1000x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here the spores are ellipsoid, and more or less hyaline, and no reactions with the Meltzer&#8217;s.  But the spores are clearly longitudinally striate here.</p>
<p>With that sort of spore ornamentation I thought it might be easy enough to come up with.  But it didn&#8217;t show up in the Crepidotus monographs, or other Crepidotus info, so that was just bothering me.</p>
<p>But with the spore striation it should be Clitopilus, but I could find much on Clitopilus info, that might give me more info on a sessile form.  So, I tabled it.  But then I got Funga Nordica recently, and for some reason I thought of this one, and thought what would Funga Nordica say?  And in their Clitopilus key there are a few sessile forms listed, and a couple that are white.  Using that key, I get a suggestion of Clitopilus hobsonii.</p>
<p>I also found on the web from Upstate New York, there was a Clitopilus key of sessile forms:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.nybg.org/bsci/res/hall/clitokey.html"">http://www.nybg.org/bsci/res/hall/clitokey.html</a></p>
<p>So, this looks pretty good.  These aren&#8217;t some funny Crepidotus, but they really are a Clitopilus.

First the Second: First time I've heard a salamander vocalize!

While getting pleasantly lost in the woods, I came upon a stream bed with some promisingly flat stones.  I've been itching to find one of the giant salamanders pretty much ever since I moved out here, and lo and behold, after a few rocks, I found this fine specimen.  And what did it do upon discovery?  It croaked!  Not metaphorically, but literally, and repeatedly!  Joy!

Note: the colors are a bit off here, probably due to using an LED head lamp as a light source.  It was actually more tan than purple.  I should probably invest in a flash.","Sonoma County, US-CA, US",38.450143806,-123.2016378423,"","California Giant Salamander","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/833","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/838/medium.jpg","kueda",833,"California Giant Salamander","Amphibia",26823,2,0,"2008-11-08 14:06:19","2008-11-08","2008-11-08 22:06:19 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,28225,"","obscured","true",NA,"",1,"2008-11-09 08:47:23 UTC","2017-01-20 20:42:49 UTC","research","CC0",NA,NA,"false"
