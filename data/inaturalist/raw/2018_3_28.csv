But most pics of it on iNaturalist don't show the hair. Calflora database <a href=""http://www.calflora.org/entry/observ.html#srch=t&lpcli=t&taxon=Phoradendron+bolleanum&chk=t&cch=t&inat=r&cc=RIV"">shows</a> the species in Joshua Tree National Park. Leaves in second pic look too fleshy, though. Just doesn't match in nice way. 

Phoradendron juniperinum is another option, but same paper (p. 25) says that <a href=""https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?taxon_id=58341"">P. juniperinum</a> leaves are ""reduced to minute scales"". Other sources, pics suggest same thing. So not P. juniperinum. And it's definitely not desert mistletoe, which is in JTNP but only attacks legumes.

... and the botanists at JTNPS also list Phoradendron serotinum subsp. tomentosum as being around. But leaves of mine not hairy.

These harvested ants and another smaller species holes were only about 10in from each other. The smaller ants would swarm a harvested and kill it and take it down there hope as seen in the third photo.

I was out exploring with @pharv001 when we found some rough harvester ants and this smaller species with there holes only 10in from each other. Every cpuple minuets a harveater ant or two would head over to the other ants and the smaller ants would swarm and kill rhem and then take them down the hole. we observed this several times. the forth photo shows how close each hole was. The sixth photo shows them taking some harvester ants down the hole.
