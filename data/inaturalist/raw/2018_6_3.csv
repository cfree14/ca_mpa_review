-Body color mainly brown
-Discal setae present
-Ocelli present
-Reticulation absent or weak
-Forewings longer than head+thorax
-Forewing setal rows widely spaced and discontinuous 
-Abdominal segment X conical, longitudinally divided ventrally

These characteristics narrow it down to 4 species, of which the two Limothrips species fit best. L. angulicornis can be ruled out due to the absence of prolonged external margin on antennal segment II.
