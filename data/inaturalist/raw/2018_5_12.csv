"Geranium wallichianum","2018-05-12 10:18:00 -0700","A cultivar of Woodland Geranium (Geranium sylvaticum), photographed in some flower beds on private property in Sunnyvale, CA.  Woodland Geranium is a native to Europe that has produced a variety of cultivars that are used in horticulture.  A number of these cultivars look very similar to the plant in the picture; for example, see the cultivar 'Amhy Doncaster' featured at this link:  https://dorsetperennials.co.uk/product/geranium-sylvaticum-amy-doncaster/

As I am unfamiliar with G. sylvaticum, I consider this identification to be tentative.  It is based mainly on it being iNaturalist's best suggestion as to what this plant could be.  The plant's 5 petals, 10 stamens, and palmatelly compond leaves indicate that it does indeed belong to the Geranium Family (Geraniaceae).  However, identifying to species will require further study and the use of European botanical references.  For now, I willl go with G. sylvaticum as this plant's identification, until someone can either confirm it or provide a better identification.

Crown Memorial Beach; Crown beach and Park St and Shoreline, East Bay Regional Parks (Alameda Ca); PSRF site monitors are continually documenting evidence of ongoing epizootic die of of SF Bay area wildlife (mostly fish, rays and sharks in that order) that appears to be linked with tide gate discharges that are depositing loads of dead and rotting carcasses along the shore lines and contaminating near shore, former tidal estuarine habitats with epizootic flourishes link the accumulating rotting carcasses and associated pathogen infections.

Clearly, the large abundances of striped bass argues against previous dismissive speculations that the die offs are result of low salinity and heavy rain fall; thats called run off anyway and I see the low salinity and cold water shock theories to be careless, without base and speculative at best.

Fortunately volunteers are mapping and documenting these events and gathering the evidence needed to carry the case forward.","Crown beach, shoreline Dr",37.766381,-122.273369,"","Striped Bass","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/12772424","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/18510542/medium.jpg","seanrvansommeran",12772424,"Striped Bass","Actinopterygii",51392,2,0,"2018/05/12 9:16 AM -0700","2018-05-12","2018-05-12 16:16:00 UTC","Arizona",NA,NA,NA,"","false","","",482880,"2018-05-24 16:21:39 UTC","2018-07-08 02:56:50 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC","",NA,"false"

A few hours later, I discovered this nest hidden in the shrubs just off my deck... Hope all goes well with both nests!   First picture, update May 23: The first sighting of one of the nestlings. Final pictures: May 27: The youngster Dove is very big already, but the parent is still in breeding position. Two hours later, I found the youngster alone in the nest, with an egg that must have failed. Early morning on May 28, the nest was empty but for the egg. One parent came back and sat on it a little while, then left. Two hours later, the egg was gone... Breakfast for any of the other animals around. And finally, 10 days later, on June 6, the youngster Dove has not yet left its spot under the shrubs, and is getting fed by its father. The nest is occupied again by another breeding Dove pair...
