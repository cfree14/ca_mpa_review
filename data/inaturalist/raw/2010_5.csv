"Podarcis siculus siculus","2010-05-22 10:01:00 -0700","Back in 2010 Gary Nafis was notified of this population and sent me to survey it. During the survey I was able to not only determine how far the population had spread, but discovered its origins and date of introduction, which was later confirmed by Guntram Deichsel via genetic data. Guntram Deichsel, Gary, and myself published a note in Herp Review. Details are given in Deichsel, G., G. Nafis & J. Hakim (2010): Podarcis siculus (siculus) – U.S.A, California, Los Angeles. Herpetological Review, 41 (4): 513-514. More pictures are presented at www.californiaherps.com.

As of 2018 the population was continuing to grow and spread. It is only anecdotal, but I did not encounter fence lizards or alligator lizards within the populated area, though both were found just outside of it. However, invasive Moorish Wall Geckos were found within the populated area.","Coastal San Pedro, Los Angeles, CA, USA",33.71832778,-118.30253333,"","Southern Italian Wall Lizard","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/41815916","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/66350594/medium.jpeg","jonhakim",41815916,"Southern Italian Wall Lizard","Reptilia",550997,1,0,"2010/05/22 10:01 AM PDT","2010-05-22","2010-05-22 17:01:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",150,150,"","open","false",NA,"",6061,"2020-04-10 11:46:03 UTC","2020-04-10 14:07:54 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

Most plants in this population showed unusual yellow flower coloration, often (as in this example) mixed with the more typical pink on the same plant, and even in the same flower.  Note that all the new buds are yellow.  And it had rained substantially the day before.

My working hypothesis: the younger, developing flowers are susceptible to differential leaching of pigments by rain water, removing the presumably more-soluble pink (anthocyanic) component(s), while those pigments have become more fixed in the older flowers.  Other ideas??
