<p>I looked at the spore for this one, under KOH.  The spores are hyaline, and in KOH, they are rather clear, and hard to see in the photos, so I won&#8217;t push them on you here.

I go round and round with this bird but mostly come back to HERG. I believe it to be a true albino* - note the sores on its bill due to lack of protection from the sun. The dark flecks in the head are feather lice. 

By the bill, especially the attenuated gentle curve to the tip of the upper mandible, and a barely defined gonys, I suspect this is a Herring Gull.

The gull was later seen at Stow Lake, so it stuck around for a bit. A large bird, it was dubbed ""big white gull"".

Shown in comparison with a hatch year Western Gull.

Keeping on mind that albinism is a complete lack of melanin, other chromatophores (xanthophores, erythrophores, cyanophores) may be present. 

Wikipedia:
It is a common misconception that all albino animals have characteristic pink or red eyes (resulting from the lack of pigment in the iris allowing the blood vessels of the retina to be visible), however this is not the case for some forms of albinism.

... Some albino animals may have pale-blue eyes due to other colour generating processes....","Presidio of San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA",37.8086471818,-122.4706007827,"albino","Large White-headed Gulls","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/54679935","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/87016661/medium.jpeg","rudyard",54679935,"Large White-headed Gulls","Aves",4343,2,0,"2009/10/15 1:19 PM PDT","2009-10-15","2009-10-15 20:19:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",2,2,"","","false","","",13370,"2020-07-28 22:35:28 UTC","2022-03-11 04:43:23 UTC","research","CC0",NA,NA,"false"

"Coronula diadema","2009-10-11 13:10:57 -0700","Are these <i>Coronula diadema</i> and <i>Conchoderma auritum</i>?  I hardly know anything about barnacles, but the ones shown here certainly resemble those two species.  I just don't know if there are other possibilities given the context.  The <i>Coronula</i> (the ones that look like &quot;normal&quot; barnacles) were about 10 cm in diameter, I think, though it was kind of hard to tell, since they were on the chin of a living humpback whale.  Observed near the Farallon Islands, ~60 km west of San Francisco, CA, USA.

Also, I've read that <i>Conchoderma</i> is merely a commensal epibiont on <i>Coronula</i>, but it really looks like it's bursting out of the inside of some of these barnacles, which seems somewhat less than harmless.  Is this just a weird angle, or is <i>Conchoderma</i> also a parasite?
