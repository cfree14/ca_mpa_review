In our own garden it is on every single plant that has flowers and throughout the entire neighborhood. This may have something to do with the ongoing drought (pollinators seeking the areas where flowers are blooming, which are mainly in irrigated areas). In natural areas the shrubs (sages etc) look poorly and blooms that occur are on small annuals and are few and far between.  Many neighborhoods and the DOT have stopped irrigation of the community slopes - most of which had iceplant species that would bloom profusely by this time - and are now completely withered.

I only found about ten individuals within this whole vernal pool/swale complex. Every single one of them was on a gopher mound. There is a poster for an article on that here: https://www.bio.fsu.edu/~nunderwood/old%20homepage/Mimulus%20poster.pdf. They only occurred on mounds within one area, maybe about 75 feet in diameter. The mounds and plants were within about 10 feet of the edge of the pool/swale complex.

Pic 3 shows the ciliate leaves and an unopened flower in the background. 
Pic 4 shows the ciliate calyx and the mostly glabrous corolla tube. 
Pics 6-8 show individual mounds bearing flowers. 
Pic 9 shows several mounds in relation to the edge on the right and the pool on the left. 
In pic 10, some of the mounds can be made out on the right and the deepest part of the pool (dry) can be seen on the left, with a blanket of Downingia cuspidata, which appears as a faint purplish-white area.
