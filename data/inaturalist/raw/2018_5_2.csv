Crown Memorial Beach; Crown beach and Park St. and Shoreline, East Bay Regional Parks (Alameda Ca).

Our 2017 leading site monitor for SF Bay (Maureen Anders) has been working diligently and consistently on mostly the Alameda side of the bay (East Bay Park's domain/watch) and has documented another spike in dead wildlife over at Crown Beach Memorial Beach and some nearby sites along the shorelines there.

Over the past weekend and again yesterday Anders noted, documented and reported a large number of dead seabass and several bat rays again depositing along shore line at Crown Memorial Beach in Alameda. Good work volunteers!

Specimens have thus far shown a plethora of pathogen infections, internal lesions and high parasite load and toxins archived in tissues and organs (public advised in 2011, following investigations that year).
The consistent and frequent strandings and dead stripe bass argues against the dismissive 'low salinity' or temperature shock explanations for these chronic die offs. This is an important if not urgent environmental issue as well as leading point science project and academic opportunity.

If you see a dead, apparently dying, distressed, trapped or entangled/injured shark, ray, skate or fish immediately contact the Pelagic Shark Research Foundation via dispatch 831 459 9346 and/or email/message PSRF's Stranding Rescue and Specimen Collecting Unit via psrf@pelagic.org

Crown Memorial Beach; Crown beach and Park St. and Shoreline, East Bay Regional Parks (Alameda Ca).

Our 2017 leading site monitor for SF Bay (Maureen Anders) has been working diligently and consistently on mostly the Alameda side of the bay (East Bay Park's domain/watch) and has documented another spike in dead wildlife over at Crown Beach Memorial Beach and some nearby sites along the shorelines there.

Over the past weekend and again yesterday Anders noted, documented and reported a large number of dead seabass and several bat rays again depositing along shore line at Crown Memorial Beach in Alameda. Good work volunteers!

Specimens have thus far shown a plethora of pathogen infections, internal lesions and high parasite load and toxins archived in tissues and organs (public advised in 2011, following investigations that year).
