"Lontra canadensis","2012-01-31 21:38:00 -0800","One of the more interesting interactions I observed from 5 years spent studying river otters was this half-assed attempt at hunting snowy egret. 

I had seen otters take birds only twice prior to this. Otters go under the water and pull the birds down and drown them. The marsh otters I saw do this were stealthy and secretive in there approach. This otter and the other actual river living otters never took birds that I saw in direct observation or in scat examination but every once in awhile they would take a run at an egret or heron. 

This otter appeared to think a quick change of direction and lunge would work but the snowy egret easily got away. I found it interesting that the bird flew a few feet away, next to the much larger Great Egret and seemed to be using the larger bird as a deterrent. The otter swam off to hunt crayfish and the egrets went back to stalking their own prey.

"Ardea alba","2012-01-09 11:15:00 -0800","This Great Egret is eating a Botta's Pocket Gopher (Thomomys bottae). This photo was taken in a small park within Griffith Park in Southern California. When I first saw it, it was standing motionless, and did so for about 8-10 minutes. I didn't notice it at first because it was so still, and when I did finally notice it, I thought it was some kind of bird statue... until I saw it suddenly move and spear something in the grass with it's bill. Suddenly, it had a meal of this gopher. It was fascinating to watch. The three photos show, first, the Great Egret picking up the gopher, which it then proceeded to slam down into the ground several times. (I suppose to kill it.) Then it began to swallow it whole (the second photo). And finally, I observed the gopher sliding down the Egret's throat. The Egret had to shake it's head and gesticulate often in order to get it to finally slide all of the way down it's gullet and finally into the crop for digestion.

The winter had been very dry. However the area in the park had a slight amount of moisture, and was a little cooler, in the 50’s. I managed to find 2 adults under logs on top of a mulch and leaf mixture. Beside one of these logs was a small juvenile buried in the debris. I found one additional adult under a log on a mound with several slender salamanders, the substrate under this log was more sand and soil but in a moister area.","Santa Cruz County, US-CA, US",37.1139985551,-121.8017560793,"Ensatina eschscholtzii xanthoptica, Yellow-eyed Ensatina, salamander, ensatina","Yellow-eyed Ensatina","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/47846","","chia",47846,"Ensatina eschscholtzii xanthoptica","Amphibia",123168,1,0,"2012-01-11","2012-01-11","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,28447,"obscured","open","true","","",4172,"2012-01-18 01:47:32 UTC","2021-09-24 18:26:01 UTC","casual","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

"Ondatra zibethicus","2012-01-14 00:00:00 -0800","While driving along Hicks Valley Rd in Marin County (accessed from Pt Reyes-Petaluma Rd), I noticed something swimming in a farm pond on the north side of the road.  I thought it might be a river otter, so my husband and I stopped to check it out.  Upon getting a better look, we determined that it clearly wasn't a river otter (I just saw one of those yesterday at Healdsburg Ridge Open Space Preserve).  Rather, it had the look of a small beaver.  We watched it swim around for a while - it looked like a long rectangular block with a long, thin tail.  Once, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it flip its tail through the air.  As far as I could tell, it was nothing more than a skinny, round tail (i.e. not a beaver tail).  According to California Wildlife Habitat Relationships range maps, muskrats occur in this area but beavers don't.  Since nutrias have been eradicated from California, it seems that Common Muskrat is the only reasonable identification; and what we saw matches pictures of muskrats that I've found online.  As we were leaving, a second individual appeared.  It was nearing sunset.  I got a crummy picture of one of the individuals - perhaps the body shape will aid in confirming the species id.","Hicks Valley Rd, Marin County, CA",38.1686333444,-122.7171698213,"Marin County","Muskrat","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/47509","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/76572/medium.JPG","emilyheaton",47509,"Muskrat","Mammalia",45763,1,0,"2012-01-14","2012-01-14","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false","","",1203,"2012-01-15 05:53:34 UTC","2018-07-20 17:14:17 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
