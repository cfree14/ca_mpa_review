"Podabrus","2018-06-17 11:47:00 -0700","Soldier Beetle (Cantharidae sp.), photographed on some toyon near the Youth Science Institute at Alum Rock County Park.  This little fellow can crawl around surprisingly fast, so I was only able to get a couple of decent shots of it, neither of them close enough to identify it to species.  

This shot provides a profile view of the beetle, showing some of the salient traits of the family Cantharidae:

1) Long, whip-like antennae consisting of 11 segments.  (They are countable in the photo.)
2) Head directed forward and downward.
3) Elytra that are smooth, soft, flexible (""leathery""), and completely covering the abdomen, or nearly so.
4) Abdomen with seven segments visible indicate that this Soldier Beetle might be female. (Most males have eight abdominal segments, but some can have only seven.)

Other traits of the pronotum or tarsi cannot really be seen in this photograph, due to angle at which the beetle is being viewed or its distance from the camera.

Shot 1:  Closeup of pollinated flower head, showing it in a somewhat disheveled state as it begins to produce the seeds for the next generation.
Shot 2:  Another closeup of a pollinated flower head, this one emphasizing the massive spikes and related armoring that emanates fro the flower's phyllaries.  These spikes are on the order of two to three inches long and about half inch wide near the base.
Shot 3:  Shows a closep of one of this plant's massive leaves.  The entire leaf can be on the order of a foot long.  Note the heavy white reticulate pattern on the leaves, which is characteristic of this species.
Shot 4:  A wide shot of the entire plant in situ.
