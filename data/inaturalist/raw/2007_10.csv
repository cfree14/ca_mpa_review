"Russula aeruginea","2007-10-27 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Kinda went back and forth on this one, but now I am pretty sure.  I measured the spore size and got ave size of 8.2 &#215; 6.7 microns, using 5 spores.  This puts it on the high side of the monograph, but that isn&#8217;t a big sampling of spore sizes, so I&#8217;ll take it.  The gills are turning yellow from the spore color, and the taste was mild.</p>
<p>The first micro. shot here is at 1000x under oil immersion, and mounted in Meltzer&#8217;s reagent.  This shows a few spores, with relatively small warts, and little to no lines between the warts.  The spores are white, but the blue-black color is the amyloid reaction of the warts to the Meltzer&#8217;s (mostly iodine).</p>
<p>The second shot is at 400x, mounted in Meltzer&#8217;s, and this is of a gill edge.  The clear longer cells are the cheilcystidia, and there are a few spots with spores still attached to the basidia.  Notice the 2-spored basidia here.</p>
<p>The third micro shot is a section of the cuticle at 400x, mounted in KOH.  The cap surface is seen here, and there are hyphal cells pointing upwards, with numerous pileocystidia as the thin hair like cells between.</p>
<p>This all matches the monograph discription of this species.</p>","Redwood National Park, Orick, California, USA",41.33555,-124.032,"","Green Brittlegill","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60653858","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97000544/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60653858,"Russula aeruginea","Fungi",122333,0,0,"2007-10-27","2007-10-27","","UTC",6737,6737,"","open","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 21:51:21 UTC","2020-09-24 21:51:28 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

The stipe was smooth, but this was because it handled so much by many students.  The stipe of the second one is more like L. magnispora, but it also looks just like L. spheniscispora.  And as far as I can tell the spores on these two species are also the same.  But also as far as I can tell, if you find it up north it is L. magnispora, so there you go.  Used to be L. clypeolaria, but the stuff in CA was found to be L. magnispora.  So, found in the north of CA with spores like this, that is the basis of the id.</p>

"Albatrellus subrubescens","2007-10-27 00:00:00 +0000","<p>I&#8217;m not sure what these are, but Dr. Largent had a name for these.  But this happened pretty often, you would wave a mushroom under his nose, and he would spout a name, and some detail about the thing.  But before you could remember the name, or ask more, he would be off, and you never got the name down for later.</p>
<p>These are all white when young, but develop yellow patches, and bruise yellow slowly.  They also have a fruity odor, with a hint of citrus.</p>
<p>If anyone has an idea let me know.</p>
<p>5/26/2008 &#8211; Getting back to these.  I was inspired to look back at these from the Fall 2007 edition of Mushroom, the journal.  This edition has a nice photo of these, in fact, it is exactly this photo of these!  He took this photo and used in the mag.  There the editor named these A. avellaneus which is going further than I had, so I thought it would go back to these.</p>
<p>In most books/keys for these you would get to A. ovinus, but the shape, mostly all white/off-white color, and fruity odor doesn&#8217;t really march.  The Pacific NW key to Polypores has a note for A. ovinus that there is A. avellaneus, and you can tell the difference in that the spores are 5-5.5 in length, where A. ovinus spores are 3.5-4 um in length.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve added a micro-shot here, which is of the inside of a pore at 1000x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  In this shot there is a basidia, and it is 4-spored, and the spores are amyloid.  Looking at 6 spores the ave. size is length  4.58 +/- 0.22, width 4.06 +/- 0.17.</p>
<p>I found somewhere in a publication for A. citrina (or something like that) that A. ovinus spores are inamyloid and that A. avellaneus are amyloid, but I can&#8217;t seem to find that ref. now.  Also in the Pacific NW key there is a note (crypticly), that A. subrubescens has amyloid spores.</p>
<p>The spore size here is a little small for A. avellaneus, but it large for A. ovinus.  Given the area (coastal Humbolt Co.), shape, look, odor, and amyloid spores, I&#8217;m going with A. avellaneus.

So, I looked at the cystidia, and they had bulbous ends, and looked that up, and came back with Conocybe.  He said no, stop saying Conocybe, look at the pileipelis.  So I did, and it was a cutis, and I looked at what that might be, so I cam back, could it be Galerina?  He said, ok finally you get there.

<p>9/3/2008 &#8211; Getting back to these from scope work on Aug. 6th -</p>
<p>Looking at some stuff from Los Trancos to get species better before starting the new season here.  Getting some Crepidotus under the scope.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot here is of the gill edge at 400x under Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here is displayed the cheilocystidia, which are fairly fat and blunt.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of cap surface material at 1000x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The surface hyphae can be seen here, and it was shown better in other photos, but you can almost see it here, there are clamp connections on the hyphae.  Also there are lots of spores here, and it can almost be seen in the shot, that they are lightly punctate, not really smooth.  The warting is so light, it is hard to get a clear photo of it.</p>
<p>With the clamp connections these are clearly not C. herbarum, which is a species without clamps.  With the think blunt cystidia, ellipsoid spores that are lightly punctate, this points to a different species in the Hesler and Smith monograph of North American species &#8211; C. amygdalosporus.</p>
<p>There is a photo of this species in the monograph, and it looks good there, but there are a bunch of white species, although this one seems to fruit in larger numbers on top of each other.

There were lots of Psathyrella candolleana around in the grass, so at first, I thought these were more of that, they were about the same color, shape and size.

When I picked them, the cap flesh is thiner, and the surface is deeply striate, and the older ones are turning black, although not as much as other Coprinellus I&#8217;ve seen (not really turning into the black goo).  If you look close you can see a bit of the flaky covering of the Coprinellus in the center tops of the caps, but just a bit, the rest must fall off pretty quick.</p>
<p>They are like Coprinellus micaceus, but then again, not really.  They are taller, the cap lighter, thiner, smoother, and less black goo happening.

"Panaeolus foenisecii","2007-10-01 00:00:00 +0000","<p>A fairly normal species to find among the grass of irrigated lawns about now.  I&#8217;ve been finding plenty of these for the past few weeks, small brown, with a very dark spore print (almost but not quite black&#8230;), and a hygrophanous cap.</p>
<p>But in class this week we were looking a number of distinctive microscopic details, and these have the epithelial pileipelis (I think I got that right&#8230;).  This is where the surface of the cap is made of large globous, thin walled cells, without any fiberous hyphae suporting them.  This can be seen in the first microscopic photo.  This was taken at 400x, mounted in KOH, and the divisions are 2.5 microns.  The cap was covered with spores, in the section I grabbed, maybe from cutting through the gills, or probably from just the fact that the cap was covered in spores.  Next time, if there is a next time, I&#8217;ll try for a cap without lots of spores.  Anyway, you can see lots of big fat round cells that make up the cap surface.</p>
<p>The second microscopic photo is still on the cap surface, but this time focused on the spores.  This was taken at 1000x in oil immersion, and the divisions are each 1 micron.</p>","Menlo Park, California, USA",37.44215,-122.1845,"","Mower's Mushroom","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60652107","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/96997858/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60652107,"Mower's Mushroom","Fungi",902551,1,0,"2007-10-01","2007-10-01","","UTC",4891,4891,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 21:35:28 UTC","2020-12-31 22:41:53 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC-ND",NA,NA,"false"

"Leucoagaricus leucothites","2007-10-01 00:00:00 +0000","<p>A mushroom brought in tonight for the mycology class, and we couldn&#8217;t place it.  It certainly looks like a Leucoagaricus species, but not one anyone knew.  Also the stipe displayed red staining when bruised, although very slowly.  It seems that the red staining turned grey in time.  The cap seems to be more grey than L.leucothites, although the cap is smooth like that one.  And that one doesn&#8217;t have a staining reaction.  The cap isn&#8217;t fibrous enough for L. barssii, and anthough that one is grey, it doesn&#8217;t stain either.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ll put it here to see if anyone has a better idea.  Also I popped them in the drier for more study later, or if anyone wants the dried samples here.</p>
<p>Ok, more details, did some microscopic work on the dried material this week.</p>
<p>The first microscopic image is of a gill, laid flat and mounted in Meltzer&#8217;s reagent, and taken at 400&#215;.  The divisions are 2.5 microns in the scale.  The spores have a funny staining reaction, it looks like some stain red-brown, some lightly reddish, and some not at all.  The ones not staining seem to be the attached ones, so it looks like that spores only stain in Meltzer&#8217;s when mature.  Does this happen?  It isn&#8217;t something I knew about, but I&#8217;m pretty new to this whole microscopic thing&#8230;</p>
<p>The second image is the same mount, but of the gill edge, also at 400&#215;.  This shows the cheilocystidia as the clear un-stained cells.</p>
<p>The third image is the same mount, but of a group of spores, at 1000x times under oil immersion.  The divisions are 1 micron in the scale.  The spores show a germ pore is present.  A few in this photo are in focus enough to see the apiculus, off-center at one end, and the small germ pore, centered at the other end.</p>
<p>The forth image is of the pileipellis (the surface of the cap), and this was mounted in KOH, and taken at 400&#215;.  The grey color of the surface cells can be seen here slightly, and the cap trama cells are thicker without color (at the bottom of the image).  The pileipellis here looks to be a cutis form to me, but like I said I&#8217;m new at this.</p>
<p>I had an e-mail from Else Vellinga about this, and she told me to look for the germ pore and if it has a cutis.  With a germ pore, and no cutis &#8211; L. leucothites, without a germ pore and a cutis &#8211; L. barssii.  But this, I think has a germ pore and a cutis, so what is that?  But I might be completely off here&#8230;</p>
<p>More conversation with Else here, and because of the germ pore, that puts this one into the L. leucothites camp.  She also mentions that in Europe there are more species recognized with grey and staining forms (I think&#8230;), but it is all L. leucothites here.  She stated that this one has &#8220;no taxonomic value&#8221;, oh well.  So, there is a slow, slight red-staining, grey, varient to L. leucothites out there, for people to keep in mind.</p>","Sonoma Co., California, USA",38.47845,-122.7035,"","White Dapperling","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60652031","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/96997730/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60652031,"Leucoagaricus leucothites","Fungi",179125,0,0,"2007-10-01","2007-10-01","","UTC",52765,52765,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 21:34:44 UTC","2020-09-24 21:34:54 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"
