"Tharsalea arota","2018-05-27 09:58:00 -0700","A male Tailed Copper (Lycaena arota), discovered along the banks of Stevens Creek as it was nectaring on some Shortpod Mustard (Hirschfeldia incana).  It cooperated enough to give me a couple of decent shots of its upperwings, but not cooperative enough for even a single shot of its underwings.  Fortunately, this is a species that can be identified from just the characteristics of its upperwings alone.  The key field marks here:  (1) The elongated, trapezoidal shape of this butterfly's forewings and the roundly triangular shape of its hind wings;  (2) the small tail along the termen of each hind wing; (3) the coppery orange to coppery brown color of this butterfly's upperwings (usually the wings are darker than this, but here, the wings are exhibiting a fair amount of fading and wear); (4) the small, dark brown dots along the ternus of the hind wings; and (5) the heavy orange line around the largest two or three of these dots.

Photographed at Stevens Creek County Park in Cupertino, CA.

"Peromyscus","2018-05-27 11:31:49 -0700","While hiking Boy Scout Tree Trailer we encountered the weirdest thing. During the first walk by we found a near-death mouse and a half eaten mouse near each other and a large redwood. The mouse that was still barely alive was still moving but not a lot. It was acting very lethargic. We left it alone and assumed a predator, such as a weasel had gotten to the mice. About 40 min later we walked by the mice again and we found a presumed adult mouse cannibalizing the already dead and half-eaten mouse. We sat there and watched the mouse eat the dead mouse for about 5 minutes before we left it alone and continued down the trail.
