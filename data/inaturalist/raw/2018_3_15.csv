"Stellaria media","2018-03-15 05:08:00 -0700","Common Chickweed (Stellaria media), photographed at Panama Park in Sunnyvale, CA, after a heavy rain.  In some of the more open flowers, one can see some characteristics that are typical of the genus Stellaria:  ovate, opposite leaves with entire margins;  axillary inflorescences of tiny, white flowers; flowers consisting of 5 sepals and 5 petals, with the petals deeply lobed (so deeply lobed that they have almost split in two); a single pistil with three styles, surrounded by a rig of stamens.  Interestingly, this shot shows the peduncles with hairs on one side only;  wikipedia seems to indicate this is a distinctive trait, but I am not sure how reliable that is.

Common Chickweed is often difficult to distinguish morphologically from Greater Chickweed (Stellaria neglecta) and Lesser Chickwee (Stellaria pallida), but it is the species most likely to be found in the lawn of an urban park (which is where found these specimens).  S. neglecta apparently has a fondness for streamsides and other damp places, while S. pallida prefers to grow in sand.

"Acacia dealbata","2018-03-15 00:00:00 -0800","Silvery grey tall bushes with bright yellow groups of pompom shaped flowers.

These tall shrubs were about 10' tall with many younger trunks evident. The leaves were mostly silvery grey, although new shoots were green.  Leaves are bipinnate, 1–5"" long, in 6-30 pairs, with 6–30 pairs of pinnae. Each pinna was composed of 10–68 pairs of leaflets. The leaflets are 1/4"" to 3"" long.  (Very like their cousin mimosa trees)

The flowers are produced in large clusters, with each individual cluster stem holding 8-10 flowers.  The flowers are rounded, bright yellow and composes of a dozen or more individual flowers. 

This stand appeared in a more or less straight line, suggesting it might have been intentionally planted although there was no evidence of a residential structure nearby.

Also called silver acacia, blue wattle or mimosa
