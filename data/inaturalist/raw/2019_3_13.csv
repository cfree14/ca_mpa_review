"Andrena anisochlora","2019-03-13 13:46:00 -0700","A female. I have seen this bee and the species foraging exclusively on Claytonia perforata on which this bee is very quick and efficient at each flower.  Wallace LaBerge (1985) lists floral records (Anagallis sp., Claytonia spathulata, Medicago sativa, Claytonia sp., Claytonia. perforiata, Nemophila sp., Stelleria media).  

Stelleria media is flowering along with Claytonia perforata in the sites I have seen this bee, but it does not visit S. media so far. I think I've seen this species visit Nemophila heterophylla last year.

Females and males stopped to sun on leaves periodically if the temperature dropped.

Males pursue females actively, or sit and wait and ambush foraging females.
