I visited this location on May 1, 2016, and also saw a pond turtle basking, but it dove off the rock and hid so I did not have a photo.

There was a fire in this area (I think late 2016) and I have not seen the turtles here since, and much of this pond is filled with silt now.  I will continue to visit this location in the future and hope to find pond turtles here or nearby (I have seen pond turtles about one mile from this location, which are already uploaded to iNat).","Los Angeles County, US-CA, US",34.3453618799,-118.1629280072,"","Western Pond Turtle","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/35709672","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/56342713/medium.jpeg","cdegroof",35709672,"Western Pond Turtle","Reptilia",73592,2,0,"2011/02/12 9:36 AM PST","2011-02-12","2011-02-12 17:36:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",10,28846,"obscured","open","true","","",80445,"2019-11-15 18:48:16 UTC","2019-11-16 00:20:16 UTC","research","",NA,NA,"false"

The bands of stipe tissue under a viscid layer (just like C. glutinosoarmillatus), non-percurrent and easily-detached stipe, and pale cap make it a poor match for T. pinguis.

@noah_siegel suggested possibly C. pavelekii, but that species supposedly lacks purple tones and grows with spruce. Also, the DNA sequence is not a good match for a reliably-identified specimen of C. pavelekii at OSU.
