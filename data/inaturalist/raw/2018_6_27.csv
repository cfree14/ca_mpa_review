This very rare species may have originated via hybridization, but if so, appears to have become isolated from at least one of its parents.

One of the parents is probably Ceanothus prostratus, which grows in abundance nearby.  Ceanothus bakeri differs in having a somewhat looser and taller, though still spreading habit, and leaves entire to only distally few-toothed (versus leaves with more and sharper teeth extending below the middle of the leaf in C. prostratus).

This implies that the other parent (if any) would have been a taller thornless shrub with thick and entire leaves, but no such species of Ceanothus currently grows anywhere near the known locations of C. bakeri.","United States",39.1284523182,-119.8509162804,"Rhamnaceae, Buckthorn Family, Ceanothus, Ceanothus bakeri, angiosperm, dicot, plant, rare, rare plant, wfgna, flora, wildflower, wildflowers, Carson Range buckbrush, shrub, shrubs, shore, forest, Nevada, North America, Carson City, Carson Range, Sierra Nevada, flowers, flower, blossom, bloom, Marlette Creek, Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit, Lake Tahoe, June, summer, foliage, leaves, leaf, Olympus, EVOLT, E-510, Olympus E-510, JDM20180593, JDM20180595, JDM20180607, taxonomy:family=Rhamnaceae, taxonomy:genus=Ceanothus, taxonomy:binomial=Ceanothus bakeri, taxonomy:common=Carson Range buckbrush, geo:alt=1908m","Carson Range buckbrush","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/63620153","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/102134357/medium.jpg","jdmore",63620153,"Ceanothus × bakeri","Plantae",181636,0,0,"2018/06/27 11:47 AM PDT","2018-06-27","2018-06-27 18:47:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",5,28151,"obscured","obscured","true","","",51061,"2020-10-27 06:34:36 UTC","2021-12-23 15:34:07 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY","",NA,"false"
