"Suillus caerulescens","2008-01-20 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Ok, getting back to this question.  I looked through the descriptions for S. caerulescens and S. ponderosus, and it turns out the clear difference to look for is that S. caerulescens has an ixotrichoderm, and S. ponderosus has radially aligned interwoven hyphae in a gelatin matrix.  Also the descriptions state that both stain in the base wehn cut (and only the base), but S. caerulescens is blue, and S. ponderosus stains green (green? only green staining boletales I&#8217;ve heard of, and this isn&#8217;t a St. Patrick&#8217;s joke&#8230;).  It would be good to see obs. of S. ponderosus and this, the next time someone sees one.</p>
<p>But anyway, I added a photo here of the &#8217;shroom cut open, and bruised from the base to the cap with a knife edge.  Only the base bruises blue, and a nice bright blue.</p>
<p>The micro-shot is of the cap surface in radial section in water at 400&#215;.  And here you can see the cells aligned pointed up to the surface, in a gelatin matrix, so this is your ixotrichoderm.</p>
<p>So, ok these are confirmed as S. caerulescens.

"Puma concolor couguar","2008-01-01 00:00:00 -0800","tracks measured 3.5 inches and the distance between the tracks was 36 inches. Small mountain lion or really large bobcat ? 
The scat pile was feline and it was a large pile as you can see when compared to the camera bag.
The tracks and scat were recorded on different trips to the same site. 
Both cats occur here and this is where I photographed hunting Bobcats. 
I have seen a Mountain lion at this site too but did not get my camera up in to take a picture. Mountain Lions are seen here with some regularity.
Is the photographic evidence enough for an ID on iNaturalist ?
