"Rusavskia elegans","2018-03-04 12:02:00 -0800","Elegant Sunburst Lichen (Xanthoria elegans), photographed at Coyote Ridge Open Space Preserve in Santa Clara County, CA. This lichen was found growing on a large rock near the top of the ridge.  It was identified based on the following characteristics:

1) Thallus color is orange to orange-red, and it is so tightly appressed to the underlying rocky substrate that it almost appeared to be crustose.  
2) Thallus forms large rosettes up to 6 cm in diameter, with tightly adnate lobes that fit together snugly, so they resemble the fingers of a glove.
3) Apothecia usually absent from the lobes but common everywhere else within the rosette. 
4) Apothecia are orange and disk-like, with crenulate margins.  These apothecia can reach 3mm in diameter, but as these rosettes appear to be fairly young, their apotheica have not gotten anyhere close to that size.
5) No soredia present anywhere in the rosette.

Xanthoria elegans can be easily confished with several orange to dull red species in the genus Caloplaca; however, these lichens are all truly crustose, with a sharp, almost geometric look to them.  In Caloplaca, the lobes are longer, and any apothecia are concentrated close to the center of the rosette.   

Xanthoria elegans can also be confused sometimes with Maritime Sunburst Lichen (Xanthoria parietina).  However, that species has lobes that are shorter, more ruffled, and more irregular in their growth patterns than Xanthoria elegans.

Note: As I am a newbie when it comes to lichens, I consider all of my lichen identifications to be very tentative.

This patch of Maritime Sunburst Lichen was found growing on the bark of a Valley Oak along the edge of the park's main parking lot.  Identified on the basis of the following characteristics:

1) Thallus yellow-orange to orange in color, foliose in appearance, forming rosettes up to 10 cm in diameter.
2) Rosettes with broad, radiating, wrinkled lobes, which are fairly tightly appressed to the underlying substrate.  (This is more apparent in the larger, older rosettes shown here.)
3) Apothecia common, darker orange than the surrounding thallus.  Apothecia tend to be most abundant near the center of each rosette.
4) Not sorediate.

This bird was part of a small flock of male and female Red-wings that landed in the tree near the preserve's entrance gate.  She was very cooperative, so I took several shots of her.

This bird seemed to be experiencing a lot of feather wear or even a prealternate molt (apparently unlikely for western subspecies of Red-wings, but perhaps this one is the rare exception?).  A lot of feathers seem to have fallen out of her face, crown, and scapulars, and there seems to be a lot of white edging to her flight feathers.

"Ranunculus californicus","2018-03-04 11:20:00 -0800","California Buttercup (Ranunculus californicus), photographed at Coyote Ridge Open Space Preserve in Santa Clara County, CA.  This is a somewhat mediocre shot of this widespread native wildflower; however, it is good enough to show several salient features of this plant:  

(1) Its basal leaves and most of its cauline leaves are ovate to round in outline, with deeply cut lobes.  The sinuses between lobes reach almost halfway to the center of each leaf.  (Some of the youngest caulines leaves appear to be elliptical and unlobed, but that is only because they haven't fully emerged yet.) 

(2) There are 5 sepals (see the closed buds), each of which is  between 3.5 and 7 mm long, but only 1 to 2 mm wide.  These sepals are also puberulent (covered with tiny hairs).
 
(3)  Flowers have more than 5 yellow petals (in the case of the open flower in the photograph, there are 12 petals.)  These petals that are generally 7-12 mm long and 5-6 mm wide at their widest points, making them substantially larger than the sepals.
  
(4) Flowers also contain 5 yellow anthers and many yellow styles.  

(5) The underside of the plant's leaves, the peduncles of its inflorescences, and the petioles of its leaves are all puberulent.","Coyote Ridge Open Space Preserve, Santa Clara County, CA",37.2294058023,-121.7129480839,"California Buttercup, Coyote Ridge Open Space Preserve, Rank 3, Ranunculus californicus, Santa Clara County","California buttercup","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/10230092","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/14142404/medium.jpg","arnel",10230092,"California buttercup","Plantae",52173,1,0,"2018/03/04 11:20 AM PST","2018-03-04","2018-03-04 19:20:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",15,15,"","","false","","",29323,"2018-03-14 09:00:17 UTC","2018-03-16 18:54:34 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

This was probably a mating pair, performing coordinated aerobatics as a form of pair bonding exercise.  The three shots show them in different positions in the sky, so one can derive a good idea of their overall shape, even if they are basically silhouettes against the sky.

In Shots 1.1 and 1.3, the wedge-shaped tail of one or both birds is fanned out completely.  When the tail is fanned out in this way, it seems to dwarf the rest of the bird.  This does not happen with Turkey Vultures (whose tails are wedge-shaped, but whose wings are substantially larger), Golden Eagles (same), or with any of our common buteos.

"Erysimum franciscanum","2018-03-04 11:33:00 -0800","San Francisco Wallflower (Erysimum franciscanum), photographed at Coyote Ridge Open Space Preserve in southern Santa Clara County, CA.  Identified by a  process of elimination.  There are five species of wallflowers that can be found in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Two are highly restricted endemics:  Erysimum teretifolium, which only grows in the sandhill regions of Santa Cruz County, and Erysimum ammophilum, which is restricted to the coastal sand dunes of Monterey County.  E. menziesii is slightly more common, but prefers the bluffs, sand dunes, and coastal prairies of the outer coast.  Its leaves also have a distinctive spoon shape to them, which is different from the almost linear leaves that the plant in the photograph displays.  

This leaves us with two species, E. franciscanum and E. capitatium.  The differences between the two are subtle:  

(1) E. fransciscanum is said to be woodier towards the roots, so that it is more or less a perennial subshrub;  E. capitatum is said to be an annual or biennial forb.  However, it is hard to conclude how woody this plant is based on its photograph alone.

2) E. capitatum is said to have cauline leaves that become sessile distally (e.g., away from the roots). From this picture, it is clear that this plant's leaves continue to be petioled, even further up on the stem.

3) E. franciscanum is known to specialize in poor soils, including serpentine soils (the predominant soil type at the higher elevations of Coyote Ridge Open Space Preserve.)  Therefore one is more likely to encounter it there than E. capitatum.","Santa Clara County, US-CA, US",37.3019530408,-121.7013669174,"Coyote Ridge Open Space Preserve, Erysimum franciscana, Rank 3, San Francisco Wallflower, Santa Clara County","San Francisco wallflower","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/10200377","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/14091710/medium.jpg","arnel",10200377,"San Francisco wallflower","Plantae",57402,1,0,"2018/03/04 11:33 AM PST","2018-03-04","2018-03-04 19:33:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",15,28417,"","obscured","true","","",29323,"2018-03-12 09:10:22 UTC","2018-03-12 13:37:14 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

"Layia gaillardioides","2018-03-04 13:21:00 -0800","Woodland Tidytips (Layia gaillardioides), photographed at Coyote Ridge Open Space Preserve in Santa Clara County, CA.  Initially, I thought this wildflower was just a Coastal Tidytips (Layia platyglossa), a much more common species occurring throughout much of California.  But then I noticed the following:

(1) The stem of his wildflower was covered with heavy purple streaks.  According to Jepson's e-Flora, the stem of L. platyglossa should not bear any purplish streaks.  
(2) The seeds emerging from the head of this wildflower appear to be reddish-brown, not the deep purplish (almost black) color of L. platyglossa seeds.

After looking through the key for the genus Layia in Jepson's e-Flora, the best fit appears to be L. gaillardoides.  L. gaillardioides is known to have heavily glandular, purple-streaked stems, and it is also known to have seeds that are white to reddish brown, similar to the ones that are emerging from the central disk of the wildflower in the photo. Distrbution-wise, L. gaillardioides has reportedly been found in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Note, however, that I don't have much experience with L. gaiilardioides, so it's entirely possible that this identification is incorrect.","Coyote Ridge Open Space Preserve, Santa Clara County, CA",37.227311,-121.711976,"Coyote Ridge Open Space Preserve, Layia gaillardioides, Santa Clara County, Woodland Tidytips","Woodland Tidytips","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/10161732","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/14024993/medium.jpg","arnel",10161732,"Woodland Tidytips","Plantae",64246,0,0,"2018/03/04 1:21 PM PST","2018-03-04","2018-03-04 21:21:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",6,6,"","","false","","",29323,"2018-03-10 04:45:55 UTC","2020-11-26 04:53:20 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

"Aquila chrysaetos","2018-03-04 11:26:00 -0800","Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), photographed at Coyote Ridge Open Space Preserve in Santa Clara County, CA.  The first shot is probably the best shot I have of this bird, as it shows several key characteristics:

1)  The long, relatively narrow profile of its wings.  Although the eagle's wingspan is enormous, its wings are relatively narrow iwhen compared to the wings of Buteos such as the Red-tailed Hawk.  Its wings also do not bend vertically to form the diheral angle of the Turkey Vulture.

2)  The tail is noticeably longer than that of either a Red-tailed Hawk or a Turkey Vulture.

3)  The underwing and undertail patterns are solidly black, indicating that this bird is an  adult.  In flighr, Turkey Vultures have a two-tone underwing pattern consisting of completely black patagials and fstk greyish flight feathers that will be visible at this distance and even in this lighting.  Red-tailed hawks will have patagials that are either all dark or white with dark spots at the ends;  their flight feathers will appear tp be white in most lighting conditions.

4) In this photo, there is a suggestions of a golden-brown color on the bird's head, which would be consistent with Golden Eagle.  It is just a hint, though, so I would consider that to be corroborating evidence from this photo, not diagnostic evidence.

In the remaining shot of the set, the bird is higher up int he sky, but it still shows many of the same characteristics described above.","Coyote Ridge Open Space Preserve, Santa Clara County, CA",37.2293032921,-121.7131519316,"Aquila chrysaetos, Coyote Ridge Open Space Preserve, Golden Eagle, Santa Clara County","Golden Eagle","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/10151866","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/14008553/medium.jpg","arnel",10151866,"Golden Eagle","Aves",5074,3,0,"2018/03/04 11:26 AM PST","2018-03-04","2018-03-04 19:26:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",23,23,"","open","false","","",29323,"2018-03-09 15:13:26 UTC","2022-03-20 11:57:04 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

My ID is based on a google search of ""pocket gopher fleas"" that resulted in a scholarly article entitled ""Fleas associated with the northern pocket gopher (Thomomys talpoides) in Elbert County, Colorado"". These fleas came from a different species of gopher but the article said that Foxella ignota was the most common flea of pocket gophers, though they did mention a couple other genuses as well. If anyone has more local information I'd be happy to receive it. I believe that F. ignota has several different subspecies, each of which are from a different type of gopher.
