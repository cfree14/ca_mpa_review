"Haemorhous mexicanus","2018-06-13 22:08:00 -0700","Es un ave originaria de México y el oeste de los Estados Unidos, pero fue introducida al este de Norteamérica en el siglo XX como ave de jaula. Con el tiempo, las aves liberadas se aclimataron en las nuevas zonas, desplazando en algunas áreas al carpodaco norteño (Carpodacus purpureus) y al gorrión doméstico (Passer domesticus). Desde el siglo XIX fue introducido a Hawái. Su área actual de distribución comprende, por el oeste, desde el sur de la provincia de Columbia Británica, en Canadá, hasta las tierras altas del estado de Oaxaca, en México. Por el este, desde el extremo sur de Ontario y Quebec hasta el norte de Florida. Habita en casi todo Estados Unidos. En México, en la península de Baja California, los estados fronterizos norteños y a lo largo del Altiplano Central y hasta Guerrero y Oaxaca. Hay una población aislada en el centro de Chiapas, que se cree podría descender de aves domésticas.

Se trata de aves principalmente residentes, aunque algunas poblaciones orientales suelen migrar hacia el sur. Sus hábitats son bastante diversos, pues reside en claros de bosques, en matorrales, desiertos, tierras altas, zonas costeras, campos de cultivo y zonas urbanas, incluyendo grandes ciudades.","Zona Urbana Rio Tijuana, Tijuana, B.C., México",32.530192,-117.022455,"bird, bajacalifornia, camachuelomexicano, pinzónmexicano, haemorhousmexicanus, carpodacodoméstico, ave, aves, jardín, jardínbotánico, jardínbotánicocect, cecut, centroculturaltijuana, tijuana, méxico, avesdeméxico, mexicano, carpodaco, camachuelo, fringillidae, américadelnorte, américa","House Finch","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/14033240","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/20765715/medium.jpeg","erickjohnsonss",14033240,"Pinzón mexicano","Aves",199840,6,0,"2018/06/13 10:08 PM PDT","2018-06-13","2018-06-14 05:08:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",17,17,"","open","false","","",754985,"2018-07-04 05:14:59 UTC","2018-07-05 18:45:03 UTC","research","CC-BY","",NA,"false"
