In group.

Red staining firm flesh. Has heft like A. Bitorquis, but not growing mostly subsurface like most ""torks"" I've found which emerge with a dirt cap.
Stipe tapers to a point.
Strong odor, but not phenolic or ""library paste"" smell of A. Xanthodermis

Have eaten others from this patch w/o any bad consequence. Flavor strong. May not appeal to some folks.
