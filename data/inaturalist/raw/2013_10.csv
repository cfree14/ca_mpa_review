"Ardenna gravis","2013-10-05 18:19:05 -0400","One of two Great Shearwaters seen on the 05 Oct 2013 Shearwater Journeys trip out of Monterey Bay, CA. This bird was several miles offshore from the Big Sur area; GPS location and additional photos will certainly come from the trip's leaders as this remains a review species in California. 

The Great Shearwater is the paler bird in the back.  Identifying marks include its large size, bright white chest (and undersides, as seen in flight), white rump (visible in flight - see my other photo), black cap (which was offset by a paler nape, seen in the field but not visible in this photo).

The smaller, darker birds with dark bills are Sooty Shearwaters.  The larger birds which are more gray in color and with pink bills are Pink-footed Shearwaters.

"Podiceps nigricollis","2013-10-08 00:00:00 -0800","These birds are an interesting study in identification and misidentification. I initially identified them as just two of the 1000+ Eared Grebes that were on Mono Lake at this time but it was pointed out to me (Thanks Jim!) that they just looked odd and I realized that with their white cheeks, flat crown, and smoothly curved back (not fluffed) these looked much closer to Horned Grebes than Eared. Horned Grebes are exceptionally rare on inland lakes in the fall and something about these two birds inspired me to do more research. 

I consulted several field guides including National Geographic (6th ed.), Sibley, Kevin Zimmer's guide to birding in the American West, and Don Roberson's website on the most misidentified birds in Monterey County.

<a href=""http://creagrus.home.montereybay.com/ID-EAGRvHOGR.html"" rel=""nofollow"">creagrus.home.montereybay.com/ID-EAGRvHOGR.html</a>

I strongly believe these birds to be 1st fall Eared Grebes (birds that hatched this year). According to these sources, first fall birds can show a much whiter face than adult birds at the same time of year, and unlike Horned Grebes whose white cheek is a clearly demarcated line just below the eye, these individuals show distinct smudginess with some grey in the auriculars (visible at larger sizes). 
The bill also is more Eared-like than Horned. On the bird in the foreground, at large size, it shows a slight upturn to the edge of the lower mandible unlike the slightly downturned bill of the Horned Grebe. Horned Grebes also generally have white tips to their bills while the bill tips on Eared Grebes are dark. 
A Horned Grebe with this much white in the face would almost certainly show a whiter neck, while the bird in the foreground clearly has a ""dirty"" looking throat. Lastly, the bird's overall shape is much sleeker than one normally associates with Eared Grebes, but these individuals were part of a group that were actively diving and feeding; activities that can lead to a more streamlined appearance.

Big thanks Jim for making me take a critical look at these birds! And thanks to Don Roberson for designing and hosting such an informative website

-
Identified months later (27 Apr 2014) -  PROVISIONAL IDENTIFICATION - Request review by tunicate specialists as I am not a tunicate specialist. ""Internet picture taxonomy"" and known marine ecological studies in San Diego Bay provide the basis of this provisional identification
-
The following description include my observations following study of photos and knowledge of Internet information.
-
Individual zooids clumped in a social colony resembling a tight bouquet. Zooids joined at the base by a narrowing stalk and leading to root-like structure - bundled stolons. Zooids opaque, body appears smooth, and mostly free of debris and other marine organisms. Individual zooids ranging from globular (which might the defensive contraction) to vase to club-shaped with short stubby siphons directed away from each other at a short angle from distal. The almost equal-sized oral and atrial siphons, show four dark (almost black) vertical stripes separating four white lobes.  The white appears more like the white in pastry glaze - broken and in varied concentrations. The white on each lobe appears T-shaped with the ""wings"" of the ""T"" pressing into the adjacent black striping and pinching off the width of the black stripes at  each siphon rim's edge. Very difficult to see, two very faint black lines extend proximal in parallel from the rim on the upper part middle of the white ""T"". Dissecting scope micrographs needed to visualize the detail better. The distribution of exterior white extending from siphon rim seem to stop on the lower portion of the siphon, and meeting the olive coloration of the zooid body extending up the siphon.  The extent of black stripe also stops upon meeting the olive extending onto the siphon with some black striping slightly further proximal down the siphon than the white stripes of the siphon.  On siphons extended by the living relaxed tunicate, the alternating black and white extend into the rims of the siphons The V-shaped ""cleft"" between adjoined atrial and oral siphons not deep, both joining to the body with some of the cleft indentation extending further down the body of the zooid like the ""cheeks of a human buttocks."" On extended siphons, the alternating white and black coloration on each siphon seem to stop before the cleft and zooid body junction.  Each extended siphon seen to possess a zone or ""neck"" of olive before joining to the main zooid body. Siphon openings appears circular to square shaped, between 1 to 2m in diameter.  Below the siphons, coloration of the distal half of the zooid outer tunic olive-brown in color gradually changing to yellow-green towards the taping basal stalk
-
Second and third photo was taken on 2 May 2014 from same location.  Unknown annelid worm parchment tube with three attached individual tunicates separated spatially.  Photos of individuals on worm tube depict attachment by basal stolons. Globular body shape might result from a freedom to spread laterally when not clustered tightly in a social colony.  Two tunicates were removed off the worm tube to show some detail of individual tunicates.
-
Note: The alternating black and white striping limited to the tips of short, stubby almost equal-sized oral and atrial siphons directed at a short angle away from each other, the olive-green-brown vase like body, the clustering of the zooids in a tight social colony with each individuals free except for the basal attachment of root-like stolons might be distinctive characteristics for tentative field identification. 
-
Introduced species - occurs worldwide, introduction likely by ballast and fouling community on boats, noted from several locations in San Diego Bay and nearby Mission Bay in other studies. Flickr photograph by Jay Vavra of specimen collected at Grape Street Pier San Diego, San Diego Bay.  Unusual photograph of colony encased in unknown mucus-like substance or water collected tightly around the specimen when collected tunicate photographed in air. The siphons closed tight and zooid bodies retracted and rounded.  Photograph does show alternating black and white on short stubby siphons with siphons located near distal and directed at a short angle away from each other, brown coloration and the basal stolons. Light might be distorted due to exposure in bright sunlight.

I was initially confused viewing the great variability among posted Internet photos labeled as P. zorritensis. Some posted Internet photographs from around the world appear NOT to match the original description by Willard G. Van Name(1931), ascidian taxonomist with the American Museum of Natural History. Van Name originally described the organism as Stolonica zorritensis in 1931, unfortunately Van Name did not collect the type specimen from the type locality at Zorritos, Peru.  Field notes especially of appearance of living specimens and ecology NOT included in Van Name's original description. A pen and ink? black and white drawing (fig 6C) depicted portion of the a colony, stalked zooids with stolons at the base, and short stubby siphons directed distally.Van Name's description of internal anatomy quite detailed.  Unfortunately Van Name original description did not described any external color distribution of preserved specimens. Later in 1945 an update entitled ""The North and South American Ascidians"", Van Name moved genus Stolonica into genus Polyandrocarpa based on internal anatomy of the testes.  Still no mention by Van Name of color or ecology in the 1945 update.  I understand color in preserved museum specimens may be altered. Yet, field biologist rely on color presents clues to make tentative field identification.  Color distribution and ecology must be noted in field notes by people collecting and studying living P. zorritensis specimens. In addition, field and lab photography of living specimens plays a great role.  Tunicates must be photographed in water in order to show relaxed siphons and body.
-
Current Internet-posted photos display varying morphology, and color patterns on photos identified as P. zorritensis. Some photos likely misidentified.  Internet research revealed genus Polyandrocarpa contains a number of named species, and the Polyandrocarpa zorritensis  complex likely contains population variants. For instance, an Italian photograph of Mediterranean collected Polyandrocarpo zorritensis showed zooids with up to eight black strips, the siphon tips somewhat crenulated and slightly flaired, white on the siphon lobes not as bright, and a red coloration the zooid tests.

-
Clarification of the genus Polyandrocarpa greatly needed. West coast tunicates still poorly known. Introduction of the now commonly found P. zorritensis to the west coast of North America seems to be a relatively recent.  Lambert and Lambert (1998) first reported the species from Southern California harbors in the late 1990's. Field guides and taxonomic keys published in the 1990s and earlier do not include the now commonly found P. zorritensis in listings and identification keys.  Currently,websites devoted to marine invertebrate introductions show limited reporting for P. zorritensis on the west coast of North America. Marine photographers at the moment passing up photographing the introduced small brown colonial tunicate. 
-
 Internet-shared photos along with field notes of living P. zorritensis greatly needed for comparative study, and to clearly photo document varying morphology and the true nature of its recent introduction both on the west coast and around the world. -
-
Request a photographic comparison via the Internet of living and relaxed, identified Polyandrocarpa zorritensis from all parts of the world.  Photograph sites like iNaturalist.org  could function as a clearing house for storage and comparison of posted photos.

 PROVISIONAL IDENTIFICATION - Unclear if I am correct with identification  since I am not a sponge expert.
-
REQUEST INTERESTED RESEARCHERS TO CORROBORATE/CONFIRM, AND CONTRIBUTE PERTINENT DATA AND COMMENTS.   California sponges poorly known as a group.  Identification based on dated marine biological/ecological studies.
-
============
-
Aiolochroia thiona, formerly known as Verongia thiona - commonly called Yellow Sponge, Keratose Sponge, 
-
Specimen collected as an epibiont from fouling community, on floating fishing dock, Boat Channel, Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD), San Diego, California
-
The specimens formed thick encrustations on small Ostrea oysters and other members of the fouling community attached to the floating fishing dock.  The species was spotted as sunlight penetrated the water and lit up the dock fouling community, and was collected by hand on two separate trips.
-
Note the distinctive spine-like structures called conules projecting around the sponge body.  The photos display many conules densely spaced together. The conules appear triangular-shaped, with a sharp tip pointed outward. Adjacent conules were joined by a connecting thin sponge tissue, and presented as an U-shaped membranous ridge connecting adjacent conules. 
-
One circular osculum (opening for excurrent filtered water) was seen in collected individuals. There seems to be a membranous transparent collar which encircles the opening of the osculum. Osculum was seen contracting as the organism was disturbed by movement. Osculum slowly opened again. On close examination, a reticulated pattern on the sponge body surface faintly seen between the conules.
-
First time in the field (5 Oct 2013) with the sponge, I noted and photographed the yellow sponge turning violet-purple upon presumed death (fifth photo).  I went home and researched the biology.  The second time (17 Oct 2013) in the field, I collected a colony and deliberately killed the sponge with isopropyl alcohol, and noted the conversion within thirty minutes from sulfur-yellow to purple-black - a diagnostic characteristic noted by California sponge expert De Laubenfels in 1932.   The third photograph depicts a living specimen placed next to a newly killed specimen.  Note the color change to dark purple, and some of the conules have lost some of U-shaped membranous tissue resulting in remainder of the conule appearing more sharply needle-shaped.  Internet research revealed color change in sponge described as ""aerophobic.""

=============
-
Initially identified to iNaturalist as sulfur sponge Aplysilla sulfurea. Further checking revealed initial identification not being correct.  Descriptive information stated the oscula  in Aplysilla sulfurea were located on chimneys which was not seen in San Diego specimens.  I studied my earlier photographs taken with grainy 400 ISO film.  I went back to collection site with 200 ISO film and a greater knowledge of field characteristics the group of sponges under study.  Isopropyl alchohol to study the color change upon death of yellow sponge.   I have edited out in iNaturalist previous information on Aplysilla sulfurea to Aiolochroia thiona including replacement of substandard iNaturalist photos to better ones. I retained one photo taken on 5 October 2013 to show the color change in a specimen undergoing death.  Literature state cellular granules released upon death to change the yellow coloration to purple.
-
Aiolochroia thiona, formerly Verongia thiona.  Identification reliant on 1932 description by De Laubenfels - The Marine and Fresh-water Sponges of California [available from the Internet] for Verongia thiona.  Much of the descriptive detail including the living yellow sponge converting from ""yellow to very dark blue or purple upon drying"" was observed.  De Laubenfels stated in 1932 -  ""I know of no other local form from which it may not easily be distinguished by its tendency (very common in this genus) to change from yellow to very dark blue or purple upon drying.""   A notable deviation from the description was the conule (spikey sponge tissue) density.  De Laubenbels described  the""surface, superficially smooth with conules 0.5 mm high, irregularly scattered.""  My photographs show the collected specimen presented with very dense conules packing providing the sponge with a spikey appearance.  De Laubenbels stated ""Verongia thiona is moderately common, at times at least, in the intertidal areas of southern California.""  The type location for Verongia thiona is Laguna Beach, just north of San Diego.
-
Amazingly, Internet searches for key words ""Aiolochroia thiona"", ""Verongia thiona"", ""yellow sponge California"", and ""keratose sponge California"" do not bring up images matching my photos.  The collected sponge is quite photogenic as a bright sulfur yellow sponge with many spikey projections (conules) projecting from the body, and grows thickly upright from encrustations.   Is it possible marine biologists and divers along the Southern California/Baja California Pacific Coast, have missed collecting or photographing a brightly yellow photogenic sponge bearing spikey projections - and a species that undergoes a dramatic color change yellow to black-purple upon death?  Possible, but not probable.   The Southern California/Baja California Mexican Pacific Coast region including San Diego Bay over time been the subject to a multitude of marine environmental studies. I also reflect on the the great west coast sponge expert De Laubenfels above statement of the sponge's ""moderately-common"" distribution.  Since De Laubenfels 1932 publication for California sponges contains matches to my observations except for the surface conule density and distribution, I elected to use the description and marine ecological distribution to identify the collected specimens.   The description is supported by two other marine ecological references.
-
Richard K. Allen 1990 Common Intertidal Invertebrates of Southern California - Revised edition states ""the sulphur sponge (Verongia thiona) is yellow and colonies grow in clusters to 25 cm in diameter.  It is restricted to southern California in the low-tide zone of back bay mud flats. Specimens have been observed at upper Newport Bay, Dana Point, and from rocks and scaled worm-shell colonies at Corona del Mar.""  The collection site for my specimens is located in a rather obscure location near the back end of an artificially created channel connected to San Diego Bay.  The banks adjacent to the collection site are lined with rip-rap rocks, however, low tide exposes a mud-sand shore.  The vague identification key describes the ""colony with a course texture; colony bright yellow.""  Unfortunate the reference does not show a figure of Verongia thiona.  A figure or photo might have been helpful.
-
A small pamphlet by Wesley Farmer 1964 One Hundred Common Marine Animals of San Diego - Occasional Papers of the San Diego Society of Natural History, Number 14. ""Verongia thiona. Sulphur sponges can grow to about 7 or 8 inches in diameter.  The animal is yellow, with occasional brown color on its surface, and has a sulfur-like odor.  Local distribution: On the undersides of rocks in the low tide zone of the rocky coast.""  Figure four depicts a poorly drawn image of the sponge, a few jagged lines could be conules.  I have not noted a sulfur smell from my collected specimens from a floating dock.  As a field biologist, I know marine animals can acquire the (hydrogen?) sulfur-smell by being contaminated with black mud.  
-
Similar-appearing California-found Aplysilla glacialis stated as having a rare yellow form.  Records are spotty and/or suspect. I have yet to find a photograph showing a yellow Pacific Coast of North America Aplysilla glacialis - all Interent and book photos I have seen show salmon to coral-colored specimens.  I hope a future researcher verifies if the A. glacialis sponge is reported to possess two color variations, and why.   I suspect an unknown yellow sponge may be misidentified as A. glacialis.  Pacific coast sponges are largely unknown as a group.  California sponges need in-depth systematic research including genetic research to clarify their biology.  
-
Other possibilities include an introduced species new to California or a new species to science. (Introduced and new species possible, but unlikely in the intensely studied Southern California/Baja California Mexican marine biological region).  If the species is an introduction the best candidate is Aplysilla longispina from the Southeast coast of North America.  Other candidates include members of genus Darwinella sp. and Subera sp. - both genera known to change from sulfur-yellow to dark purple to black.  However, both sponge genera described from other parts of the world, and not California.","(MCRD), San Diego Bay, San Diego, California ",32.736765,-117.207681,"Aiolochroia thiona, Verongia thiona, Yellow Sponge, Keratose Sponge, San Diego, San Diego Bay, California","","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/427437","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/548581/medium.jpg","peabodysherman",427437,"Aiolochroia thiona","Animalia",256011,1,0,"2013-10-17 12:00","2013-10-17","2013-10-17 19:00:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false","","",20829,"2013-10-13 18:04:11 UTC","2019-04-05 22:55:34 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

"Myrmicinae","2013-10-11 10:00:00 -0700","There are several nest openings along the west fence of the Park, the middle third which is the driest.  This opening had very agitated red ants with a few Argentine ants.  I could not tell who was winning.

I assume the red ants are harvester ants P.  californicus but I'm no expert.

Sometimes there are as many as 5 or 6 openings with many active foragers.  So far, they seem to hold their own againgst the Argentines who mostly live in the irrigated north and south ends of the Park.

When Park hosts big events like Hard Summer concers, electrical cables are laid over the nest opening along the fence.  It takes several days after the concerts for the nests to reopen.  It also seems that spraying water on the walking/running track around the perimeter of the park gives an opening for the Argentines to expand their territories.","los angeles state historic park",34.069702,-118.230738,"","Myrmicine Ants","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/425828","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/536250/medium.jpg","suepea",425828,"Ants (Family Formicidae)","Insecta",69143,1,0,"2013-10-11  10am","2013-10-11","2013-10-11 17:00:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false","","",22545,"2013-10-11 19:40:41 UTC","2022-02-09 14:18:09 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

-
Zoobotryon verticillatum attached to floating dock, recreation area, Marine Corps Recruit Depot, very common, Spaghetti bryozoan found on low tide rocks and around eelgrass seagrass forming mats of tan. Many epibionts attached to bryozoan branches. Other free-living organisms hide among the branches. 
-
Literature states spaghetti bryozoan is likely an introduction.  The species shows worldwide distribution. 
-
Organism was identified as Zoobotryon pellucidum in the past - Hedgepeth et al 1968, Between Pacific Tides, stated ""A southern form, known from San Diego Bay only, is the soft Zoobotryon pellucidum, which forms great, flexible, treelike masses.""
-
five photos contributed
-
The first and second photos show brown branching organism ""in situ"" attached to floating dock edge. Bryozoan was photographed by peering over the dock edge as strong morning sunlight  was streaming at an angle into the water and lighting up the dock fouling community. Some sunlight on water reflected off the water onto the photos.
-
The third photo of collected colony placed in plastic tank with overhead photography.

-

She found her way inside the house where she got trapped on a glue trap. My nephews and I rescued her, but in the process lost her tail and set her free in the garden outside. I believe I re-introduced these lizards to the neighborhood since the last time I spotted lizards in the area was more than 25 years ago. I just wish that the gopher snakes, come back so they can take care of the heavy rat population in this area. My friend captured one close to 30 years ago.
