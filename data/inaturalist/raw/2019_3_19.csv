The habitat was located on a flat plain below a hill. There were a few bigger trees behind this plant but not many. The soil of the bush was semi  moist. The flowers at the end of the stems were brown and decomposing. There were red veins and edges on all leaves and stems. However the plant did seem to be dying as there were large amounts of browning leaves and stems. Large parts of the plant were still alive. The weather was 64 degrees Fahrenheit and sunny.
