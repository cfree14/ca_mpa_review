Set contains 2 photos - the lead photo, which provides a close-up of the plant's inflorescence, and a shot showing the entie plant in situ.

When this photograph was taken (early April), this plant was young enough to not have produced any seed-bearing nutlets.  Unfortunately, nutlet characteristics are key to differentiating the genus Cynoglossum from the other genera belonging to the Borage Family.  Even so, the plant's blue-and-white flowers and long, tongue-like leaves are distinctive, so it is hard to to mistake this plant for anything else.","Montebello Open Space Preserve, Santa Clara County, CA",37.3230759367,-122.178633213,"Cynoglossum grande, Hound's Tongue, Montebello Open Space Preserve, Rank 1, Santa Clara County","Pacific hound's tongue","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/10923905","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/15363761/medium.jpg","arnel",10923905,"Adelinia grande","Plantae",769151,1,0,"2018/04/01 1:27 PM PDT","2018-04-01","2018-04-01 20:27:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",8,8,"","","false","","",29323,"2018-04-14 22:27:58 UTC","2018-08-21 07:56:25 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

This is the well-known fernthat has the cream-to-yellow exudate covering the underside of its leaves, hence its common name.  For this specimen, the exudate is cream-colored, as you can see from the still somewhat-curled-up new leaves.  No other fern in the area has this ""dusting"" of exudate on the undeside of its leaves, so the exudate is a reliable field mark for P. triangularis.  (There are other ferns that produce an exudate covering the underside of their leaves, but their natural range is well outside the San Francisco Bay Area.)","Montebello Open Space Preserve, Santa Clara County, CA",37.3183320587,-122.1668422222,"Goldback Fern, Montebello Open Space Preserve, Pentagramma triangularis, Rank 2, Santa Clara County","goldback fern","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/10610955","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/14798323/medium.jpg","arnel",10610955,"goldback fern","Plantae",52676,1,0,"2018/04/01 11:06 AM PDT","2018-04-01","2018-04-01 18:06:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",15,15,NA,"","false","","",29323,"2018-04-04 11:01:40 UTC","2018-04-12 20:02:25 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC","",NA,"false"

"Cardamine californica","2018-04-01 13:15:00 -0700","California Milkmaids (Cardamine californica), photographed along the Stevens Creek Nature Trail at Montebello Open Space Preserve in Santa Clara County, CA.  Identified as such on the basis of the following characteristics (per Jepson's):

1) Four petals, arranged in a ""Maltese cross,"" with 4-6 stamens and a single pistil with a single style  (Gets me to the Mustard Family, Brassicaceae.)
2) Plant generally glabrous (no hairs).
3) Cauline leaves always present; cauline leaves not basally lobed or clasping. (Gets me to Brassicaceae, Group 2).
4) Flowers radial
5) Stamens 6; ovary, young fruit linear.  (See the flower but that is about  to open, as well as the emerging seed capsule to the upper left of the open flower)
6) Cauline leaves compound
7) Plant terrestrial (Gets me to the genus, Cardamine).
8) Cauline leaves pinnately compound, leaflets 3.
9) Sepals 4 mm long, petals 15 mm long.
10) Petals white or pale rose. (Gets me to Cardamine californica.)

Note: C. californica also has rhizomes that produce leaves which are reniform in shape, in contrast to the plant's compount cauline leaves.  I did not see those leaves for this particular specimen (perhaps they were eaten by some animal?), but I did see them on many of the other examples of California Milkmaids that I saw at Montebello.

1) Stem present.  (This eliminates 5 species in California that do not have actual stems.)
2) Stipules very much smaller than the leaves; lateral petals very much longer than the sepals.  (This eliminates Viola arvensis.)
3) Leaves simple. (This eliminates four species having compound leaves, including Viola douglasii.)
4) Lower stem prostrate to erect, with leaves and peduncles. (Eliminates V. glabella and all forms of V lobata.)
5) Plat without stolon-like stem. (Eliminates V. sempervirens, which actually has sole-like sems.)
6) Petals white at least adaxially, lateral petals with large purple spots basally, above a small, basal, yellow area.
7) Leaf not shiny; cauline leaf bases cordate to truncate; plant glabrous to puberulent (here, the puberulence is restricted to the leaves and the lower stem).
