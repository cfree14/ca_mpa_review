"Tursiops truncatus","2018-05-25 15:36:17 -0700","I think these were common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) because of their solid dark gray coloring and the size/shape/position of the dorsal fin (“falcate”=sickle-shaped; hooked).  I couldn’t see the rostrum well.  The appearance of the right-side individual in the third photo made me consider short-finned pilot whale, but I ruled it out because of the fin size and shape and also the contour of its body so visible in photo 1.

Behavior: The centipede is very active and was constantly running around and trying to hide within the folds of the towel. It seemed to run around less when hiding in the folds of the towel. I flipped the towel folds over with a flashlight to get a clearer picture but it would immediately start running. This was the only picture I could get.
Other observation: I accidentally touched it and it felt cold.
