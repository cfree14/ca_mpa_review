<p>On rotting logs.  When young, very yellow, lemon yellow, in the cap and gills.  Mostly gregarious, not fasciculate.</p>
<p>Adding some micro-details:</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in KOH.  The cheilocystidia are of two kinds, chrysocystidia, and leprocystidia.  The chrysocystidia are mostly clavate to random, the leprocystidia are thin-walled, fusiod to fusiod-ventricose, hyaline.  The pleurocystidia are all leprocystidia, similar to the cheilosytidia.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the spores from the gill at 1000x in KOH.  The spores are ellipsoid, smooth, with a germ pore.  The apr. size is 7 &#215; 4 um.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t seem to be in Colman&#8217;s Thesis on CA Pholiota.  Funga Nordica sort-of id&#8217;s to Pholiota subochracea, except the spores are wrong, too large, and with a germ pore.  Can&#8217;t get anywhere with the keys in Smith and Hesler (in general).  The descr. in Smith and Hesler for P. subochracea has the cystidia close, but again the spores are wrong.  Also the colors and size are wrong too.  Not in Noordeloos Strophariacea, and it def. knocks out P. subochracea based on the spores (and the photos there are quite different).  So, it was seen a number of times this weekend, but no idea how to id it.</p>","Yosemite National Park, California, USA",37.84,-119.5405,"","Scalycaps","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60689886","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97063277/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60689886,"Pholiota","Fungi",64076,0,0,"2011-09-17","2011-09-17","","UTC",48882,48882,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-25 06:53:38 UTC","2020-09-25 06:53:44 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

<p>Adding some micro-details:</p>
<p>The micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The cheilocystidia are fusiod-ventricose, with blunt ends, on a non-fertile edge.  Pleurocystidia were also obs., similar and numerous.  The spores are dextrinoid, and come from 4-spored basidia.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the cap surface at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The surface is a cutis, without a gelatin layer.  There are a few pileocystidia obs. here (they might be hard to see&#8230;), the pileocystidia are mostly similar to the cheilocystidia, but tend to be random, spread out and sparse.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of the stipe apex at 400x in KOH.  The caulocystidia are fusiod-ventricose, and numerous, and were obs. at the apex and the base.</p>

<p>Putting this together (and it almost needs all of this info), I get to Galerina perplexa.  With some caveats, the spore size is too big here.  In the European source Haan and Waylen (rip), the spore size is listed as 8-9 &#215; 5-6 um.  In Smith and Singer the north American source, it is listed as 8-11 &#215; 5-6.5 um.

<p>The first micro-shot is of a gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  There are no cystidia obs. here, even though there are lots of basidia obs. on the edge.  2-spored basidia were obs., and the spores are non-dextrinoid.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the pileus context in radial section at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The cap surface is a cutis, with no gelatin nor pileocystidia.  The hyphae near the surface were incrusted with pigments.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of the stipe apex at 400x in KOH.  The caulocystidia are tibiiform and capitate, numerous at the apex and base.  No clamp connections were obs.</p>
<p>The forth micro-shot is of spores on the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  The spores are ellipsoid, tan, finely roughened, no plage was obs.  The apr. size is 14 &#215; 7 um.</p>
<p>The lack of cystidia was a problem, the gill edge did not look abused, but the mushroom did show signs of age.  But with the caulocystidia being tibiiform, the non-dextrinoid spores, and the lack of clamp connection, that gets the species close enough.  With the 2-spored basidia, and the large spore size, this puts this into Galerina subclavata.</p>
<p>There is a problem, I&#8217;ve only seen this one clearly once before, and in Europe.  At that time, one of the key features was the pileocystidia, and this one doesn&#8217;t have that.

"Pogonomyrmex subdentatus","2011-09-23 07:15:00 -0700","<i>This lesser-known Pogo is found in California, extreme SW Oregon, and parts of Nevada, USA.
In many ways, this ant resembles P. salinus, and the two are probably closely related. Both are members of the 'occidentalis complex'.
Pogonomyrmex subdentatus workers average about 6mm in length, and are of a uniform red, or brownish-red color.
The appearance of the propodeal spines is variable, ranging from small denticles, to long spines. The specific name subdentatus refers to the tooth-like ventral process of the petiole. A blunt postpetiolar ventral process is also present.
P. subdentatus workers forage individually, sometimes recruiting nestmates to exploit a food source. Seeds and other plant parts are collected, and insects and insect parts are also scavenged. Nests are extremely variable, made of sand and gravel, often with no distinct form, and often with more than one entrance. At one location, nests were observed in hard, rocky soil, gravelly sand, and built of fine sand among dunes. Nests can contain several hundred workers.
[image 4: yellow arrow indicates petiolar ventral process, or 'tooth', white arrow points to blunt postpetiolar ventral process - both present in Pogonomyrmex subdentatus workers, though exact form and development of features can vary</i> (DLQ Loc: 074)

This distinctive goldenbush is essentially endemic to the Great Basin and some adjacent mountains of the western United States.

In the White Mountains it is only known from desert elevations on the east and especially northeast sides, in or facing Nevada.

Tent caterpillars
Western tent caterpillar - Malacosoma californicum
Pacific tent caterpillar - M. constictum
Forest tent caterpillar - M. disstria
(Lasiocampidae)


Pg. 20

The Pacific tent caterpillar occurs in California, Oregon, and Washington and is reported only on oaks.


The western tent caterpillar occurs west of the Rocky Mountains and in New York. Four subspecies (Malacosoma californicum ssp. ambisimilis, californicum, fragile, and recenseo) with distinct geographic ranges are reported in California. The species is reported on oak, willow, poplar, birch, alder, madrone, ceanothus, redbud, hazel, ash, toyon, apple, almond, apricot, cherry, prune, plum, coffeeberry, currant, antelope bitterbrush, and apple.


Pg. 21

Western tent caterpillar larvae spin large tents of silk (fig. 13) and the larvae do most of their feeding in the tents.

Forest tent caterpillars do not construct tents; they construct silken mats on branches or the trunk where the larvae congregate when at rest or during molting.

"Veromessor andrei","2011-09-02 00:00:00 -0800","I am hoping this is the first of many ant pictures due to the fact that Wendy Jones and I are starting to do a survey of the ants found on Pepperwood.
These ants are harvester ants. I saw this group collecting seeds for three days and probably more. I had trouble getting a picture since everyone was moving along so quickly. I noticed this one ant going pretty slowly and stopping every so often. Another ant that was not carrying a seed kept bumping into this one as if to get her to keep working. This one found a small indentation where she could stop and no one tried to get her to move along until someone finally did (second pic) and she headed toward the nest.
I learned later that the ants that go out looking for food are the oldest ones so they are of less use to the nest as a whole. It made me sad to think this one was probably not going to live for much longer (workers live about two to three months).","Pepperwood Preserve, CA",38.5674391552,-122.6888564229,"","Andre's Harvester Ant","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/38617","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/64303/medium.JPG","curiousgeorge61",38617,"Messor andrei","Insecta",370875,1,0,"2011-09-02","2011-09-02","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false",NA,NA,714,"2011-11-09 04:49:24 UTC","2017-05-06 19:47:22 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
