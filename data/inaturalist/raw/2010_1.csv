<p>Looking at the sources with the grey colors, and the fusoid cystidia, this strongly suggests that these are M. galopus.

<p>Trying to see if I can id Mycena from gill features only, and not sure.

"Alnicola","2010-01-31 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Found under red alder.</p>
<p>Sorry for all the photos, but no one really posts Naucoria, from anywhere it seems, so I thought I would make up for it a bit&#8230;</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The cheilocystidia is evident, fusoid-ventricose with elongated acute apecies.  Also there was no pleurocystidia obs, the spores are non-dextrinoid, and from 4-spored basidia.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the stipe apex at 400x in KOH.  This shows the caulocystidia, here a number of the cystidia are multi-septate.  But in the bottom half of the photo there is a cluster of cystidia that are fusoid-ventricose with elongate pointed apecies.  And intermixed with these are glose elements also.  So these have caulocytidia of different kinds in clusters.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of spores on the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  Here the spores are ellipsoid, pointed, and warted.  The spores are 9.96 +/- 0.82 um, width &#8211; 5.40 +/- 0.57 um &#8211; q : 1.86 +/- 0.27, on 14 spores.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve should have looked for these before.  I was always a little confused as how easy it would be to tell a Naucoria from a Galerina, as small mycenoid fungi with ornamented brown spores.  But the Naucoria spores are more consistently warted with small regular warts, and Galerina spores are more randomly roughened, so you can tell them apart.</p>
<p>With the multi element caulocystidia, It didn&#8217;t look like any Naucoria from Europe are like this.  I couldn&#8217;t find much in the way of Naucoria info from North America.  It makes me feel bad for these pore ignored little guys&#8230; no one to care for them&#8230;</p>
<p>In trying to look up Naucoria obs. from California, it kinda makes me not want to use the name Naucoria.  Lots of stuff was Naucoria in the past, Tubaria, Galerina, Simocybe, Phaeocollybia, and others.  Any small brown spored genus seems to have been Naucoria at some point in the past almost.  But the only stuff left in the genus now are these small guys, with warted spores under alder or beech.  Perhaps it would be better to call them Alnicola, as many have done.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some unknown, probably undescribed Naucoria from California.</p>","Point Reyes National Seashore, Marin Co., California, USA",38.0848,-122.8675,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60681953","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97050241/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60681953,"Alnicola","Fungi",864956,0,0,"2010-01-31","2010-01-31","","UTC",22489,22489,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-25 03:51:58 UTC","2020-09-25 03:52:10 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge in Meltzer&#8217;s at 400&#215;.  Here are the metuloid encrusted cystidia, obs. on the edge and gill face.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of spores from the gill in Meltzer&#8217;s at 1000&#215;.  The spores are smooth, non-dextrinoid and slightly pointed.  They are apr. 8.5-10 um long.</p>
<p>Using the Nishida key to the Inocybe of California, and using a few assumptions/observations&#8230; the top of the stipe is pinkish/lilac colored, the brown of the cap and stipe is slightly purple in tone.  With the very shaggy base to the stipes, this seems to be more common in the Inocybe without cystidia on the bottom half of the stipe.  So, with the key you get Inocybe phaeocomis var. major.</p>
<p>Unless someone has a better guess, I&#8217;ll go with it.

"Galerina","2010-01-31 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Found under red alder, on alder duff and the little alder &#8220;cones&#8221;.</p>
<p>First micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here the cheilocystidia are numerous and obvious, fusoid-ventricose with blunt apecies.  Also obs. were plenty of pleurocystidia, also numerous and obvious.  The spores are dextrinoid, and come from 4-spored basidia.  In other obs. the cap was a cutis with no gelatin or pileocystidia.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  Here are spores, they are ellipsoid, pointed, roughened, with a plage on the slight super-hilar depression.  The spores are apr. 9 um long.</p>
<p>So, as small brown jobs with roughened dextrinoid spores, these are Galerina.  Growth on alder duff is kinda a weird habitat for such.  Also with the numerous pleurocystidia, this makes these a cousin to the common G. autumnalis/marginata.  Also common is the stipe covered in fine white hyphae, so this guy is in the section Naucoriopsis (which means Naucoria shaped really, not like Naucoria in other ways, except there are more like Naucoria in the growth on alder).  They are different from G. autumnalis/marginata in that habitat, color, presence of veil, cystidia shape, and spore size and shape.</p>
<p>Since growth in alder duff was strange enough, and the light yellow-tan colors of these guys, it looks like these are probably a new species of Galerina.  Although other species have been listed as found on alder wood from time to time.  Looking through a few sources, no similar species came up.</p>

<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in KOH.  Here the cystidia are lageniform, with sub-capitate apeces, the cell walls are thick-ish but not that thick.  Also similar pleurocystidia were obs. and numerous.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of spores from the gill at 400x in KOH.  The spores are ellipsoid, smooth, and have a small germ pore (hard to see in the photo, sorry).  The spores are not truncate, but smoothly ellipsoid to slightly pointed.</p>
<p>It seems that the non-truncate spores is the main feature that keep these as P. longistriata, if they were truncate with a larger germ pore they would be P. ellenae.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60679770","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97046399/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60679770,"Psathyrella longistriata","Fungi",118274,0,0,"2010-01-29","2010-01-29","","UTC",703,703,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-25 03:17:31 UTC","2020-09-25 03:17:38 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

<p>This one had been bothering me for years.  I only found this one when it was old, and I couldn&#8217;t tell if it was Psathyrella or Coprinellus/Coprinopsis.  Finally found a young one, and it doesn&#8217;t look like Psathyrella now.  So, getting a little closer&#8230;</p>
<p>Adding microscopic details&#8230;</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the cap surface at 400x in KOH.  Here the surface is cellular, of globose cells in a single layer.  There are numerous pileocytidia, which are fusiod to fusiod-ventricose with blunt to acute apecies, regularly species on the surface.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in KOH.  Here are cheilocystidia also fusoid-ventricose, thin walled, hyaline, numerous.  No pleurocystidia were obs.  4-spored basidia were obs.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of spores on the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  The spores are dark grey-brown ellipsoid, smooth with a clear germ pore, about 10-11 um long.  Also caulocystidia similar to other cystidia were obs.</p>
<p>This all matches up pretty well with the description in Champions du Suisse tome 4 of Coprinus impatiens, and the photo of the guys in-situ is a good match also.  I then found it matches pretty well with the Coprinus key from the PWN key counsil, so I&#8217;m not sure what my problem is, I should have id&#8217;ed this years ago.  Then I see that it also has a mention in Arora&#8230; if I had just followed the keys, and believed what they were saying to me.  I just had to wait years until I had a dried sample in hand, and microscopic details to just get the same result.</p>
<p>Checking in Index fungorum, it seems that this species has been moved into Coprinellus from Coprinus.  So, anyway, there a fairly complete id, perhaps not that uncommon a species, and looks fairly easy to id by eye, in the future.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60679569","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97045827/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60679569,"Coprinellus impatiens","Fungi",410688,0,0,"2010-01-29","2010-01-29","","UTC",703,703,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-25 03:13:02 UTC","2020-09-25 03:13:14 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

"Pituophis catenifer annectens","2010-01-24 12:52:00 -0800","Found under carpet padding...

This Alligator lizard crawled to the gopher snake while photoing lizard.. My Bother, Chris Wells, then noticed the snake was entangled with some netting.. It was like the gator lizard was trying to tell us something about his friend..

We cut the netting away from the pad, and took the snake to the truck, to remove the netting from the snake. The netting was cutting into the snake pretty bad. So strand by strand we surgically cut away the netting and freed the snake... We felt good about doing our good deed, and we released the gopher snake into a hole near by so he could rest....

I now know the following things about mosses:

1) They are very small
2) There are a lot of them
3) Did I mention they are small?

Ok, I learned a whole lof of other things, like terminology and what features you should look for to begin making an ID.  The instructor showed us a bunch of different mosses, but I figured I would try to memorize one common one, and this is it: <i>Atrichum selwynii</i>.  It grows on soil, the leaf is relatively large, the costa (midrib) is obvious and extends to the end of the leaf, the leaf has serrations you can see in a hand lens, and the leaf has a wavy pattern that you can see with the naked eye.
