Grows in sandy areas...hence the name Sand Verbena. Grows between February and September-or May, depending on the website.  Needs rain to grow, but when it does it carpets the area! Fragrant flowers. The round purple clusters make it easy to identify. 
According to southwestdesertflora.com the Desert Sand Verbena is used as a diuretic (Paiute) and as a dressing for burns (Shoshoni).

This bunch of flowers was when we had rain in the desert. This plant was once a very important food for Native Americans. Too many uses to list here! Most often grown from seed. Tall stalks, and easy to identify as it is one of a kind! 
Flowers from March-June.
