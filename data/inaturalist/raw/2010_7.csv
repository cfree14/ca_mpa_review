"Prionus lecontei","2010-07-10 22:29:33 -0700","Seen at night. Thanks to Dennis Haines on bugguide for the identification and the details.

Two similar species - Prionus californicus and Prionus lecontei. Differentiated based on whether the antenae show 12 or 13 segments. In P. californicus segments 12-13 are fused into one.

&quot;Prionus adults emerge from midsummer into fall, move about nocturnally and drawn to light, may fly into windows at night, crashing violently. Among the largest of the long-horned beetles, Prionus adults may be over 2 inches long with grubs growing over 4 inches long. Prionus califonicus range from Central California to Alaska and east into the great basin states and Eastern Washington.&quot; (from <a href=""http://www.bentler.us/eastern-washington/animals/insects/beetles/california-prionus-beetle.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">www.bentler.us</a> )","Mines Rd",37.53868,-121.565691,"","LeConte's Prionus","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/30279807","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/47296970/medium.jpg","ameet",30279807,"LeConte's Prionus","Insecta",305749,1,0,"2010-07-10 22:29:33","2010-07-10","2010-07-11 05:29:33 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",22681,22681,"","","false","","google",10129,"2019-08-06 00:30:39 UTC","2019-08-06 18:01:45 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC-SA",NA,NA,"false"

They are an introduced species in California and Arizona, where they were was first reported in 2008. They're a pest, targeting kale, radish, cabbage and turnips. The adult bug is typically shield-shaped, 5 to 7 mm long and 3 to 4 mm broad at its widest area. The upper surface has a mixture of black, white and orange markings, which gives the insect its common names harlequin bug or painted bug. 
The life cycle lasts 3 to 4 weeks and several generations may occur in a year.
