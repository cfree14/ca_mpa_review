-Body color mainly brown
-Forewing longer than head+thorax 
-Forewing setal row on first vein incomplete, second row complete
-Metanotal median setae arising behind anterior margin
-Paired campaniform sensilla present on metanotum
-Median spinula present on mesothoracic furca, absent on the metathoracic furca
-Discal setae absent

These traits narrow it down to 3 species. 

-Toxonothrips gramineae has a different head shape and antennae coloration.

-Thrips madronii and Thrips magnus are pretty similar, but madronii seems to be the better fit based on antennae segment III coloration.

"Cordylanthus tenuis brunneus","2018-06-25 14:57:04 -0700","Cordylanthus tenuis ssp. capillaris

Flagged for curation 6/28/2020. There was a taxon swap back in February citing Plants of the World online, which says C. tenuis ssp. capillaris is synonymous with C. tenuis ssp. brunneus. Jepson, Calflora, CNPS, and federal and state agencies still distinguish between the two. According to the January 2020 CDFW Special Vascular Plants, Bryophytes, and Lichens List, Cordylanthus tenuis ssp. capillaris is a separate subspecies and is federally endangered and listed as state rare. Subspecies brunneus isn't listed but is being displayed as FE on iNat. C. tenuis ssp. capillaris has outer bracts that are three lobed and occurs on serpentine in only a small part of western Sonoma County, north of Occidental. C. tenuis ssp. brunneus has outer bracts that are not lobed and is more widely distributed.
