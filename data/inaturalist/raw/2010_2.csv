<p>This is an example of a somewhat common species in California, or at least it seem more common the past couple years, I saw it a few times this past trip to California.  I&#8217;ve been calling it that unknown Tubaria.  I knew I had looked at it under the scope before, but didn&#8217;t really get anywhere with it, and giving the amount of good info on Tubaria, not sure it would go anywhere.  But the cap is cellular, and if you say it is a Flammulaster because of that, then check in Funga Nordica at least, you can get somewhere, kinda.  These look fairly good for F. rhombosporus, with the somewhat angular, pointed spores.  There is some info on this one the web from others:</p>

<p>the first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x (my notes say KOH, but it looks like Meltzer&#8217;s there&#8230;).  The cheilocystidia are cylidrical and inflated with blunt ends.  No pleurocystidia were obs.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the cap surface at 400x (again looks like Meltzer&#8217;s&#8230;).  The surface is an epithelium, with no gelatin, no pileocystidia.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of spores from the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH (that is right this time).  The spores are ellipsoid, smooth, with a clear germ pore and somewhat truncate, grey-brown.

<p>Looking in the US and European sources, with the lack of pleurocystidia, and spores also agree well, these are really Psathyrella candolleana.  They are kinda funny looking, compared to the normal obs. of these in grassy areas.  But then mention how this is a rather variable species, with lots of variations stated in the past.

"Psathyrella senex","2010-02-12 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Found on the bark of live oak trees.</p>
<p>This id doesn&#8217;t seem bad, but with Psathyrella it never seems to leave you with a comfortable feeling.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in KOH.  Here the cheilocystidia are lageniform, some inflated, mostly with blunt apecies, a few with inflated to subcapitate apecies.  Numerous pleurocystidia were also seen, similar to cheilocystidia.  2-spored basidia were obs.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the cap surface at 400x in KOH.  Here the cap surface is a cellular epithellium, with no gelatin or pileocystidia obs.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of the stipe surface at 400x in KOH.  Here the caulocystidia can be seen, mostly lageniform, with some globose elements.</p>
<p>The forth micro-shot is of spores from the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  The spores are ellipsoid, grey-brown, smooth, thick-walled, with a small germ pore.  The germ pore is quite small on these, less than 1um.  Ave spore size : length &#8211; 7.59 +/- 0.60 (err 0.15) um, width &#8211; 4.73 +/- 0.27 um (err: 0.08) &#8211; q : 1.61 +/- 0.10, on 17 spores.</p>
<p>So, looking in the monographs, actually in the Smith monograph it suggests these might be P. obsutata, but that didn&#8217;t quite seem right.  It seems these should have a shaggy veil, but only when quite young.  There is some veil fragments on margin on the younger ones, and these go away in age.</p>
<p>With that, then they get to a better place with P. senex.  This is also the id in the keys in Funga Nordica and Kits van Wavern, so it looks like a fairly good id.  It is mentioned that these are fairly rare in Europe, but more common in North America.  The type location is upstate New York with Peck, but Smith found them quite often it seems in Michigan.  He mentions an id from Idaho, so he thought they were in the western US also.  So, this id looks fairly good.</p>
<p>Then again, it isn&#8217;t like there is going to a lot of people looking at Psathyrella that are going to disagree with me&#8230;</p>

<p>The first micro-shot is of a gill edge in Meltzer&#8217;s at 400&#215;.  Here the cheilocystidia can be seen, and they are lageniform, with slightly swollen apecies, although not capitate.  The spores are also dextrinoid, and in other obs. no pleurocystidia were obs., the basidia are 4-spored, the cap was a cutis.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of spores and caulocystidia from the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  Here the spores are ellipsoid, and there is a perispore that has loosened, and shows &#8220;ears&#8221; around the apiculus.  So, these are calyptrate spores, and otherwise more or less smooth.</p>
<p>Notes on this id&#8230; I&#8217;ve been calling these G. sahleri, and that is a &#8220;good&#8221; id in the fact that the obs. match the species description fairly well.  Except, that there are a number of species that would also kinda match the obs. fairly well, depending on how broad you think each species might be.  So, these might be this species, or might not, and might require work with the type sample of the species, not sure I want to go that far.  But at least all obs. of this &#8220;species&#8221; in California by me, are all the same species.

"Resupinatus applicatus","2010-02-12 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Found under CA bay, big leaf maple.  Mushrooms pretty small, only 3-5 mm in size.</p>
<p>Adding some micro details.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 1000x in KOH.  Here there are plenty of basidia, but in between, at the same size there are pointed cystidia.  These are rather short pointed cystidia.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of spores from the gill at 1000x in KOH.  The ave spore : length &#8211; 4.64 +/- 0.36 (err 0.13) um, width &#8211; 4.37 +/- 0.23 um (err: 0.10) &#8211; q : 1.06 +/- 0.06, on 10 spores.</p>
<p>Looking at some sources, it looks like this agrees with Resupinatus applicatus fairly well.  The spores for most are listed as small and globose to subglobose, so the size and shape match well there.  The cystidia are more of a problem, some sources list the species as not having cystidia, some list it with different cystidia.  At least in Funga Nordica they have pointed cystidia drawn there for the species, so that is at least some of a match.  This species seems to be so little studied, that almost anything could be true&#8230;</p>
<p>It also doesn&#8217;t look like this species is obs. much in the western US.  It is listed in the PNW keys on PLEUROTOID SPECIES in the Pacific Northwest.  They also mention a confusion with Resupinatus striatulus, but it seems some call these a synonym?  Don&#8217;t know, and I don&#8217;t really have more time to search on more sources of this one.

<p>This one is a little funny, mory grey than brown in the cap, and the gills are marginate, but only lightly grey.</p>
<p>Adding some  micro details.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the cap surface in radial section at 400x in KOH.  Here the cap surface is a cutis, of slightly inflated pigmented elements.  Looking around some of the elements point upward, but not many, and in all cases they are long hyphae, not globose elements.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of gill edge at 400x in KOH.  Here the cheilocystidia can be seen, there are several different kinds here, some lageniform, some cylindrical, some clavate.  And some are the womping big suckers, like large inflated balloons with a roughened surface.  The edge cystidia are all slightly pigmented and smoky.  Also obs. were plenty of pleurocystidia, which were mostly lageniform and thin walled, and hyaline.  There were some, widely spaced, pleurocystidia that were largely inflated and smoky pigmented.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is also of the gill edge at 400x in KOH, showing more of the different types of cystidia.</p>
<p>The forth micro-shot is of spores from the gill at 1000x in KOH.  The spores are thick-walled, ellipsoid, smooth without a germ pore.  The average size of the spores was measured as length &#8211; 7.34 +/- 0.47 (err 0.13) um, width &#8211; 5.60 +/- 0.39 um (err: 0.11) &#8211; q : 1.31 +/- 0.06, on 16 spores.</p>
<p>I knew this was an interesting one, and I wanted to use some of the ref. that Else mentioned recently on the BAMS e-mail list, and give it a try.   These are pretty cool under the scope with the smoky cystidia.  With the thin walled pleurocystidia, I got that this is in the section Hispidoderma of the genus Pluteus.

"Hohenbuehelia grisea","2010-02-12 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Found on the bark of live oak.</p>
<p>The micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in KOH.  The metuloid cystidia here are numerous.  The cystidia are kinda interestingly encrusted, many encrusted in the top half, ending in a hard line.</p>
<p>Adding more micro details:</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the squashed gill edge at 1000x in congo red.  Here are the smaller cystidia with a single projection.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of the squashed gill face at 1000x in congo red.  Here are the encrusted metuloid cystidia.</p>
<p>The forth micro-shot is of spores from the gill at 1000x in congo red.  The ave. spore size is : length &#8211; 7.16 +/- 0.43 (err 0.17) um, width &#8211; 5.77 +/- 0.58 um (err: 0.22) &#8211; q : 1.25 +/- 0.11, on 8 spores.</p>
<p>With the single projections to the smaller cystidia, from Funga Nordica this matches &#8211; H. grisea.  It seems some sources have Hohenbuehelia atrocaerulea var. grisea and other have Hohenbuehelia grisea.  And Index Fungorum call these synonyms.   So, anyway this seems to be a good id, even though others seem to find this id fairly questionable or uncertain.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60681239","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97049007/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60681239,"Hohenbuehelia grisea","Fungi",340993,0,0,"2010-02-12","2010-02-12","","UTC",703,703,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-25 03:40:18 UTC","2020-10-03 13:22:11 UTC","needs_id","","",NA,"false"

"Galerina nana","2010-02-08 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Found under redwood, in a grassy area.  No moss anywhere near by, no obvious woody debris or rotting wood.  On edge of irrigated, landscaped, well tended lawn.</p>
<p>These were kinda exciting to find, I&#8217;ve been looking for them for awhile.  They have been reported from California, but there was not much in the way of details, just random reports.  But here they are.  They are kinda a half-way species between Galerina and Inocybe, with the thick-walled incrusted metuloid cystidia.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t look like Inocybe though, they look like just another Galerina.  Although umbonate, and sometimes acutely.  Strangely found in grass, although the amount of woody debris that might be in the soil is unknown, and was at the edge of am area with redwood duff.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here the incrusted metuloid cystidia can be seen.  There are also lots of obvious similar pleurocystidia.  Many 4-spored basidia were also obs.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of spores from the gill at 1000x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here the spores are ellipsoid, pointed, roughened, dextrinoid, with a clear plage seen on most.  The spores are apr. 10-11 um long.</p>","Menlo Park, California, USA",37.44215,-122.1845,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60680986","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97048582/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60680986,"Galerina nana","Fungi",179174,1,0,"2010-02-08","2010-02-08","","UTC",4891,4891,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-25 03:36:50 UTC","2020-12-09 00:27:24 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC-ND","",NA,"false"

<p>Adding microscopic details -</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here the lecythiform cheilocystidia can be seen, so this is really a Conocybe.  Also there are no pleurocystidia, and there are 4-spored basidia.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of some cap tissue at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The cap is hymeniform, so it is still a Conocybe, also there is no gelatin or pileocystidia.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of the stipe surface from the apex at 400x in KOH.  Here the caulocystidia are also all lecythiform.</p>
<p>The forth micro-shot is of some spores from the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  The spores are smooth, ellipsoid, brown, with a germ pore.  The spore size is length &#8211; 13.77 +/- 0.81 (err 0.20) um, width &#8211; 7.95 +/- 0.44 um (err: 0.12) &#8211; q : 1.73 +/- 0.10, on 17 spores.</p>
<p>So, putting this together you get Conocybe tenera.  The most important feature here is the lecythiform caulocystidia at the stipe apex.  The other features prove it is a Conocybe, and are needed so it isn&#8217;t in some other genera, but are mostly common among most Conocybe.  The caulocystidia here give you the species.</p>","Page Mill Rd., Palo Alto, California, USA",37.3895,-122.1615,"","common conecap","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60680959","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97048500/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60680959,"Conocybe tenera","Fungi",121765,0,0,"2010-02-04","2010-02-04","","UTC",2775,2775,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-25 03:36:12 UTC","2020-09-25 03:36:22 UTC","needs_id","","",NA,"false"

I ran over and saw it was a lizard and was able to catch it. Very mean, biting and pooping as usual so I couldn't get any insitu shots. We took him home to show my wife and son and take pics. We even set it up with a nice temporary home as you can see in pics, but my wife wouldn't let me keep it so we brought it back. This is one of the longest ones I have found with a really long tail despite the tip being regrown.

The tree is still around six feet wide up 110 feet from the ground. The base has a large goosepen and has a hole through the center. This tree lives at an altitude of 2350 feet or so. This tree lives on a slope, so the diameter breast hight could not be measured at 4.5 feet above the ground.

"Riccia lamellosa","2010-02-19 11:51:00 -0800","No reproductive structures, and the thallus-only key seems to get microscopic pretty quick (air chambers?!).  Still, this one was weird: kind of aquamarine, growing on very exposed soil in the dryest part of the chaparral, and those weird little Y-shaped channels at the ends of the leaves.  Leaves were almost entirely sessile.  

If I make some assumptions in the key, this might be <i>R. glauca</i>: whitish-green thallus, central groove narrows and disappears proximally.
