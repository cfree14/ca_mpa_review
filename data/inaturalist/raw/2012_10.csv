This is an hepatic phase (meaning tannish-orange rather than gray) juvenile female Common Cuckoo and was probably the rarest bird known to be in North America at this time.

Found across Eurasia, this Common Cuckoo likely flew down the wrong coast and instead of ending up in Japan or SE Asia, it showed up in central California. In just a few days, hundreds of people came to see it. While there have been a few records from the Aleutian Islands and one from mainland Alaska, this was only the second ever of this species in the lower 48. The last one was in New England in 1981.

It appeared to be eating good numbers of wooly-bear caterpillars.

Tent caterpillars
Western tent caterpillar - Malacosoma californicum
Pacific tent caterpillar - M. constictum
Forest tent caterpillar - M. disstria
(Lasiocampidae)




Pg. 20

The Pacific tent caterpillar occurs in California, Oregon, and Washington and is reported only on oaks.


The western tent caterpillar occurs west of the Rocky Mountains and in New York. Four subspecies (Malacosoma californicum ssp. ambisimilis, californicum, fragile, and recenseo) with distinct geographic ranges are reported in California. The species is reported on oak, willow, poplar, birch, alder, madrone, ceanothus, redbud, hazel, ash, toyon, apple, almond, apricot, cherry, prune, plum, coffeeberry, currant, antelope bitterbrush, and apple.






Pg. 21

Western tent caterpillar larvae spin large tents of silk (fig. 13) and the larvae do most of their feeding in the tents.

Forest tent caterpillars do not construct tents; they construct silken mats on branches or the trunk where the larvae congregate when at rest or during molting.

At the picnic tables, we were being given a fascinating lecture on the invasive ice plants, and all the while, the seagull was there at the edge of the cliff, looking out over the ocean. After a while, one of our classmates looked perturbed and said ""Is it injured? It's missing one of its legs!"" 

And we all looked again, and indeed, it looked like it was only standing on one leg.

To everyone's relief, another classmate responded that it was normal behavior, and that it was just a way of warming up its resting leg.

And, to everyone's amusement, the instructor's response was: ""Or, you know, it could be doing that on purpose to make you feel sorry for it and give it some food"".

"Carcharodon carcharias","2012-10-30 00:00:00 -0800","Two great white sharks battled from Manhattan Beach Pier
<6a0120a77b966b970b017c32f176a3970b-400wi.jpeg>A fisherman on Manhattan Beach Pier hooked two great white sharks Tuesday, one estimated to measure 5-6 feet and the other 7-8 feet.

Both sharks were cut loose after being reeled to the surface and both catches were witnessed by Eric Martin, director of the Roundhouse Marine Studies Lab and Aquarium at the end of the pier.

White sharks are protected off California and landing them is illegal.

While the unnamed angler released both specimens, and may not have broken any laws, he appears to have been walking a fine line.

""He has steel leaders, and I looked in his bucket and saw that he's using large dead mackerel for bait, so he seems to be fishing for this stuff,"" Martin said. 

These were the fifth and six white shark battles Martin has witnessed from the pier since mid-July. The first incident became tense because the angler was insistent on gaffing and hauling his catch onto the pier. He consented to let Martin cut the line only after a heated argument and a threat to call the police. 

There has been a large abundance of market-sized squid in South Bay  waters in recent weeks. This could be attracting rays, small sharks and and other prey items preferred by juvenile white sharks.

""It's so weird because I've also seen two swim-bys recently, including one that involved about a 7-footer that ended up about 20 feet from a surfer,"" Martin said. ""The surfer had no idea.""

""The news of a rare bird sighting in the wetlands near Ramsay Park has set hearts aflutter in the birding community.

Lois Goldfrank, a veteran Santa Cruz County birder, spotted what's been tentatively identified as a common cuckoo on Friday morning at Watsonville Slough while on an outing with the Santa Cruz Bird Club.

The Common Cuckoo, a 13-inch bird also known as the Eurasian cuckoo, breeds in Europe and Asia, and winters in central and southern Africa. The bird rarely has been seen in North America and then mostly in Alaska's westernmost islands. The only other recorded sighting of the cuckoo in the lower 48 was in 1981 on Martha's Vineyard.""","Watsonville Slough, CA",36.913798,-121.769155,"","Common Cuckoo","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/129430","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/182961/medium.jpg","jmaughn",129430,"Common Cuckoo","Aves",1907,2,0,"2012-10-02","2012-10-02","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",52,52,"","open","false","","",2873,"2012-10-02 23:40:40 UTC","2018-08-06 11:32:12 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
