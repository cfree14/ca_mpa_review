"Elgaria multicarinata","2013-11-13 15:30:00 -0800","""I've been meaning to submit these photos for a while. We see these creatures all the time in our backyard. There is a county easement at the back of our yard between our block and the next which I think increases chances of wildlife. We get tons of birds, butterflies, these lizards, caterpillars, and occasional possums and raccoons, even a coyote recently.

""These photos are of I think a large alligator lizard, maybe a foot long including tail? Taken Nov. 13, 2013 at 3:30 in the afternoon.

""I'm also including a photo of our yard for reference (though it is much more lush now with vegetables, natives, and fruit trees).""

She wasn't sure what it was. She called me to come and see. I was very surprised to see it was a fox having never seen one in the almost 20 years I have lived in Rancho Cucamonga. I have had raccoons, squirrels and opossums come into the yard over the years. I have also seen a few coyotes in the neighborhood. I figured I might see a mountain lion before I would ever see a fox. I really didn't know a fox was even a possibility. 
I looked out into the backyard and it ran to the fence you see in the picture and just stopped and starred at me. I ran and got my camera and was able to come back and take several pictures. It just remained starring at me. I was very lucky to get this picture. He/she finally went up the hill and ran away."" -Robert Bray

"Isocheles pilosus","2013-11-17 14:28:44 -0800","Update 5 June 2014: Now thinking this is Isocheles pilosus (Moonsnail hermit) as per Gregory Jensen's 2014 edition of ""Crabs and Shrimps of the Pacific Coast,"" p. 213 (and nice included CD with video showing an isocheles burying itself).﻿ The claws seem correct (better seen in video), hairy antennae, and the carapace is greyish with the rest of the crab whiteish. Very pale brown stripes on the legs, barely visible when you zoom in.

Original Description: This white hermit crab was discovered under the sand by my son (sandcastle building). It quickly ""swam"" under the sand again when we put it down. I've put a video of this happening on YouTube to aid identification: http://youtu.be/_IXi0LSS01M
