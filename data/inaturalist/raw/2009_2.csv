"Corallorhiza mertensiana","2009-02-01 12:57:00 -0800","This was one of several we found today, but it had the best light by far, a rarity for these guys.  Of course, the moment after I took this the sun ducked down behind a large tree.  Ah the vagaries of forest photography.","Plantation, California, United States",38.5728874207,-123.3163833618,"","Pacific coralroot","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/1451","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/1683/medium.jpg","kueda",1451,"Pacific coralroot","Plantae",49444,2,0,"February 01, 2009 12:57","2009-02-01","2009-02-01 20:57:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,NA,"","false",NA,NA,1,"2009-02-02 04:55:21 UTC","2020-05-30 21:51:19 UTC","research","CC0",NA,NA,"false"
"Scoliopus bigelovii","2009-02-01 14:42:00 -0800","This is a fetid adder's tongue (<i>Scoliopus bigelovii</i>), a flower I've been strangely fixated upon this winter.  Seems every time I go to Salt Point in the winter I'm a few weeks too late for these gorgeous flowers, but this time I stumbled upon a patch in bloom.  Actually, I was scanning for mushrooms when I smelled something sweet and unpleasant.  Next thing I know I'm staring the source in the face (they mimic carrion to attract polinators).","Walsh Landing, California, United States",38.5698356628,-123.3161773682,"","California fetid adderstongue","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/1450","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/1681/medium.jpg","kueda",1450,"California fetid adderstongue","Plantae",48990,2,0,"February 01, 2009 14:42","2009-02-01","2009-02-01 22:42:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,NA,"","false",NA,NA,1,"2009-02-02 04:55:20 UTC","2021-02-14 06:14:40 UTC","research","CC0",NA,NA,"false"
