"Toxoptera aurantii","2018-05-23 08:44:00 -0700","Black Citrus Aphid (Toxoptera aurantii), photographed on the leaves of a Camellia (Camellia japonica) in Sunnyvale, CA. Identification is tentative, based mainly on the fact that Toxoptera aurantii seems to be the only aphid species associated with Camellias.  Their bulbous shape and dull black color is consistent with T. aurantii;  other diagnostic features, such as its short, black-and-white banded antennae, are not visible at this level of magnification.  The closely related Brown Citrus Aphid (Toxoptera citricida) is similar, but it is restricted to citrus host plants only.

The photograph also shows a number of ants shepherding the aphids for their excreted ""honeydew.""  These ants are probably Argentine Ants (Linepihtema humile), which are the most common ant in our urban areas.  Of course, at this level of magnfication, they cannot be identified to species.
