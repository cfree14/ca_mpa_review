"Rattus rattus","2018-03-13 00:00:00 -0800","Gray above, sharply defined bright white below, about 5"" long body +head. Tail length = or < (head + body), looks fuzzy in backlighting. Pretty face, easily mistaken for a hamster if you can't see its tail, as in observation from Feb 12 ( I believe this is the same animal from that observation).  Moves silently, spiraling up & down tree branches like a gray ghost. You can't see its face in these pics because it was stuck in an orange, which it only stopped eating briefly to glance down at me while I took photos. 

There seem to be 2. One night, while I tried to  photograph it in the tree, (I've been trying for weeks to get good pics), I heard a long, raspy variable squealing sound above me, as if it said something to a companion, (like ""take care of yourself buddy, I'm goin' for it!-- Aaaaiiiiii!!!!""), then it jumped out of the tree on the side opposite me and my flashlight, making its escape in the ivy, leaving another animal moving in the leaves. My red filter on the flashlight seems to allow me to get closer without alarming them as much.

I'm ready to call it a rat. It's not anything else. I take some joy in seeing my photos are of a live, active animal, as opposed to most of the images of rats in the id page for Rattus.","Division St, Los Angeles 90065",34.11384,-118.222555,"","Black Rat","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/10252451","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/14183014/medium.jpeg","crayonsss",10252451,"Black Rat","Mammalia",44575,0,0,"2018-03-13","2018-03-13","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",30,30,"","open","false","","",164021,"2018-03-16 00:30:04 UTC","2018-09-17 23:41:38 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
