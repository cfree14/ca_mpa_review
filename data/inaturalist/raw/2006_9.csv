But there is a lot of overlap between hypothejus and d. v. californicus in the Agaricales of CA., a lot.  In the end the discription of d. v. c. matched these just fine, while for hypothejus these fall into the sometimes looking catagory.</p>
<p>Mostly I am going to call them d. v. ca. as a kinda challenge to Hygrophorus experts out there.  If the descriptions in the guides are so close, and really there were very few details that one had the other didn&#8217;t (I think only lactifers present or absent&#8230;), then how are these two species determined?  In the original notes on d. v. ca. it states that the material has only been seen in northern Sierras above 5000 ft., and in Jackson St. forest in Mendocino Co.  Which is where I have seen these, so I&#8217;m going for it for now, until an expert can point out the difference.</p>","South Lake Tahoe, California, USA",38.8697,-120.0295,"","Herald of Winter","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60010562","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/95925539/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60010562,"Herald of Winter","Fungi",118324,0,0,"2006-09-30","2006-09-30","","UTC",11957,11957,"","open","false","","",734334,"2020-09-18 21:19:41 UTC","2020-09-18 23:29:18 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

"Boletopsis smithii","2006-09-30 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Found under conifers in the Echo Summit area, south of South Lake Tahoe.  In a forested area near a large grassy clearing.  The center of the grassy clearing was a seepage area, but this was 50-100 yards from where these were found.</p>
<p>The spot on the pores in the second shot was from KOH, which stained the pores a yellow brown.</p>
<p>7/16/2008 &#8211; Getting back to this one.  I&#8217;m not a polypore type of guy, partially because I was taught most of what I know from Dennis Desjardin, and he is not a polypore type of guy, and also because I just don&#8217;t find that many of these.  In this case, this is the only Boletopsis I&#8217;ve found anywhere, so its not something I know much about.</p>
<p>But this observation has been picked up by &#8220;Mushroom the Journal of Wild Mushrooming&#8221;, and was noted as interesting by Leon Shernoff there.  Part of the interest was the &#8220;orange&#8221; color of the cap.</p>
<p>As part of this, I&#8217;ve gone back to the original photos and I&#8217;ve done a more careful color correction.  Maybe this has reduced the &#8220;orange&#8221; color, I&#8217;m not sure, to me it didn&#8217;t have much of an orange in the first place.  Not like some Lactarius or Hygrocybe, now those are orange.  But perhaps for Boletopsis slight shadings are important.  In any case, this does spark some interest in these, and it would good to find more and see what things look like in comparison.</p>
<p>Anyway, the initial comment was that as an orange Boletopsis this is a rare siting of B. skamaniensis (MtJoWM vol. 25 no. 4) , which in further comments this was equated with Albatrellus skamanius (MtJoWM vol. 26 no.1).  The further comments go on to say that A. skamanius is more known from the NW, and was very rare, but with further study has been seen from more places now, and they site a paper.  But with an orange color from the Sierras this is more probably Boletopsis smithii.</p>
<p>He mentions that B. smithii is about 2 inches in size, and these were 3-4 inches in size.</p>
<p>He mentions that at the foray it was interesting that this specimen seems to have been brushed off as just another weird color variant.  I don&#8217;t think it was that conscious, it was more, hey looks like a Boletopsis?  You know anything about Boletopsis?  Nope not me, what does Arora say, don&#8217;t know it looks like B. subsquamosa is what he suggests.  Great, close enough for me, lets keep going&#8230;</p>
<p>I would like to thank the comments in &#8220;Mushroom the Journal&#8221; from Leon Shernoff and Jim Ginns about this observation, there is a number of interesting things about Albatrellus and Boletopsis mentioned in the articles, and I will make an effort to be careful about Boletopsis that I find in the future.  (Since I didn&#8217;t put much care into finding this one&#8230;)</p>","South Lake Tahoe, California, USA",38.8697,-120.0295,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60010417","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/95925320/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60010417,"Boletopsis smithii","Fungi",1130835,0,0,"2006-09-30","2006-09-30","","UTC",11957,11957,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-18 21:18:23 UTC","2020-09-18 21:18:27 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

3/3 genitalia of a different ovipositing female. 

In our area these females oviposit: 1) coupled with the male after copulation; 2) with the male hovering above; 3) solo. They do not brush their tails in water to brush off eggs in the usual manner; rather, they fly among the rushes at the pond margins and drop eggs from about 2-4 feet onto dried mud. The eggs then have to survive until the following spring when the pond level rises again. I find this species only at ponds that dry up, partially or completely. The strategy must work because this is a very abundant species. This pond is normally completely dry by mid-autumn.

I could share more interesting observations about this species but this site does not appear to be a good place for discussion of behavior.","Sobey Pond, Arastradero Preserve, Palo Alto, CA, USA",37.3718769711,-122.1846195587,"","Striped Meadowhawk","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/21918386","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/33963280/medium.jpeg","instar",21918386,"Striped Meadowhawk","Insecta",113521,1,0,"2006/09/23 3:54 PM PDT","2006-09-23","2006-09-23 22:54:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",298,298,"","","false","","",1443166,"2019-04-02 19:27:37 UTC","2019-04-02 19:45:43 UTC","research","CC-BY",NA,NA,"false"

2/5 In the Anisoptera, the male’s cerci grip the female behind the eyes, with his epiproct in front and between them. Often the male loses interest after a while and females are seen ovipositing solo.

3/5 The Black Saddlebags male releases the female for oviposition; she swipes the tip of her abdomen in the water brushing off an egg or eggs; he then reseizes her. This image shows the moment of release.

4/5 The male grabs the female first with his legs, then transfers the grip to his terminal appendages. The drop-and-grab take only a fraction of a second; the transfer is not normally visible, but one might surmise that in general this is the way male dragonflies seize females.
