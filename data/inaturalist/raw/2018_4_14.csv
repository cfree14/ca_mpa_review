"Euchloe ausonides","2018-04-14 10:47:00 -0700","Large Marble (Euchloe ausonides), photographed at the Stevens Creek Tidal Marsh in Mountain View, CA.  Identified as such based on the following:

1) Dominant white wing color suggests that this butterfly belongs to the Pieridae, the butterfly family that contains the whites, sulfurs, and yellows.  
2) Though the wing venation is a little difficult to see in this shot, one can see the radial vein near the costa of the forewing, as it forks into four separate branches.  This further confirms tat this butterfly belongs to the Pieridae.  (Leg characteristics would provide final confirmation of this, but unfortunately, I was not able to get a shot of this butterfly's legs.)
3) Dominant white wing color further places this butterfly in the the subfamily Pierinae, which contains the whites only.
4) The irregular mottling that is barely visible on the hindwings eliminates all of the species in the Pontia and Pieris genera that have been found in the San Francisco Bay Area in the past.  None of these Pontia or Pieris species have this trait.
5) Lack of orange at the tips of the forewings eliminates Sara's Orange-tips (Anthocharis sara) from consideration.
6) Gray markings at the tips of the forewings are much too heavy for Boisduval's Marble (Anthocharis lanceolata).  This leaves us with only two species for consideration - the Small Marble (Euchloe hyantis) and the Large Marble (Euchloe ausonides).
7) With the Small Marble, the black markings at the tips of the forewings remain discrete; they do not run together as they are for the butterfly in my photograph.  Also, there is little to no yellow along the veins of the Small Marble's hindwings, whereas the butterfly in my photograph exhibits a fair amount of yellow along those veins.  These traits eliminate Small Marble from consideration, meaning that the butterfly in my photograph is a Large Marble (Euchloe ausonides).

The Western Grebe is the only bird that is not asleep.  In this view, once can see all of the field marks that distinguish it from the closely related Clark's Grebe (Aechmophorus clarkii):  the yellow-green bill, the black cap extending down the face to just past the eyes, and the extensively dark flanks.  Clark's Grebe has an orange bill, a black cap that avoids covering the eyes, and noticeably paler flanks.  

The two other Aechmophorus-type Grebes in the photo are probably also Western Grebes, based on the dark coloration of their flanks; however, as hybrids between the two species are possible, I'd rather identify them when all of the field marks are visible.  Consequently, I am leaving them as Aechmophorus-type Grebes.","Salt Pond A2W, Mountain View, CA",37.4359411641,-122.0696108043,"Aechmophorus occidentalis, Mountain View, Oxyura jamaicensis, Rank 2, Ruddy Duck, Salt Pond A2W, Santa Clara County, Western Grebe","Western Grebe","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/11009132","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/15518039/medium.jpg","arnel",11009132,"Western Grebe","Aves",4235,1,0,"2018/04/14 11:17 AM PDT","2018-04-14","2018-04-14 18:17:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",5,5,"","open","false","","",29323,"2018-04-16 13:21:04 UTC","2018-05-02 21:55:46 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
