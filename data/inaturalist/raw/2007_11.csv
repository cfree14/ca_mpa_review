"Galerina badipes","2007-11-17 00:00:00 +0000","<p>This one has confused me for awhile now, but I think this might be right.  In Smith and Singer, they basically have G. badipes and G. cedretorum as similar species, which are split at the first being 2-spore basidia and with a veil, and the later 4-spored basidia and without a veil.  They also split the 2- and 4- spored basidia by spore size, 2-spored basidia produce spores 9.5-12 um long, and 4-spore basidia produce spores 7-10 um long.</p>
<p>These have smaller spores, and no veil, and are somewhat different than the G. badipes seen here, so these are G. cedretorum.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here you can see the finger-like cheilocystidia (lageniform).  And lots and lots of dextrinoid spores.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the spores from the stipe apex in KOH at 1000&#215;.  The wrinkled surface here can be seen, and some show evidence of a plage, and some with a ragged edge.

<p>The first micro-shot is of the pileus in radial section at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  The top surface can seen to be a epithellium, layers of inflated globose cells.  There seems to be a few long filamentous hyphae on tope of these, perhaps from the partial veil.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here the cheilocystidia can be seen on a non-fertile edge.  They are fusiod-ventricose.   No pleurocustidia were observed, and the basidia are 4-spored.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of spores from the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  Here the spores are dark coco brown, smooth, ellipsoid with a distinctive germ pore.  Also the spore are slightly flattened, wide in face view than side view.  The very rough ave. size is 12 &#215; 7 um.</p>
<p>Putting this all together and going to the North American species of Psathyrella, A. H. Smith (1972), you get Psathyrella longipes (p93, #56).

<p>These were found in the duff under live oak.  Getting around to looking at Inocybe before the new season starts up here.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here the cheilocystidia can be obs, which are long and clavate, with broad blunt ends. No pleurocystidia were obs. in these.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the stipe surface near the apex at 400x in KOH.  Here lots of caulocystidia can be obs., dense and common, and similar to the cheilocystidia.  No caulocystidia were obs in the bottom half of the stipe.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of the spores at 1000x in KOH, from the stipe apex.  The spores are ellipsoid, blunt, smooth, and very light tan, without a germ pore or nodules.  The ave spore size : length &#8211; 8.62 +/- 0.54 (err 0.14) um, width &#8211; 5.40 +/- 0.28 (err: 0.09) um &#8211; q : 1.60 +/- 0.08, on 16 spores.</p>
<p>Putting this together with F. Nishida&#8217;s key to California Inocybes, along with the univ. veil tissue embedded in the cap surface, this comes out as Inocybe brunnescens.</p>
<p>As a bonus, when I was looking for cystidia in the bottom of the stipe, I found these funky guys, and this is included in the forth micro-shot.  These things were like warted globes on long thick hyphae (without clamp connections&#8230;), and were found on the surface of the stipe.  They were quite common, but I&#8217;m pretty sure they are not part of the Inocybe.  What they are, I have no idea, but they are cute, and pretty funky.

"Crepidotus crocophyllus","2007-11-25 00:00:00 +0000","<p>8/6/2008 &#8211; Getting to these -</p>
<p>Looking at these under the microscope now.  Along with Psathyrella I wanted to try a few Crepidotus also.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of hyphae from the pileus surface at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  Here  there is clearly clamp connections, I&#8217;ve been told this is fairly obvious for most Crepidotus, that the clamps in the surface hyphae are large.  Also these hyphae are pigmented and nicely textured.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  There are cheilocystidia observed here, these are cylindrical, and bent and some wavy, with blunt ends.  There are no pleurocystidia observed.</p>
<p>The third micro-shot is of some spores taken from the gill at 1000x in Meltzer&#8217;s.  I can&#8217;t take spores from the stipe apex, since there is no stipe, I need to think of a better way to look at mature spores in these.  Here the spores are globose, warted/spiny, brown, non-dextrinoid and inamyloid.</p>
<p>Putting this together and using The North American species of Crepidotus by Hesler and Smith, the species does drop out fairly well, as C. crocophyllus.  The one weird bit is that this is a fairly good cap, young and clean and the gill don&#8217;t show any of the orange color shown in other sitings.</p>
<p>It is certainly not C. mollis, which was the quick guess from Arora.  C. mollis is lacking clamp connections, and the spores are ellipsoid and smooth.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","Saffron Crep","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60655402","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97003324/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60655402,"Crepidotus crocophyllus","Fungi",154733,0,0,"2007-11-25","2007-11-25","","UTC",703,703,"","","false",NA,"",734334,"2020-09-24 22:08:16 UTC","2020-09-24 22:08:25 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

<p>But this is one of the species that I wanted photgraph, when I start to photgraph species.  I had a problem with the fact for this one, that for field guides, they would have space for one photo of a species, and for this one they would choose the best photo possible.  So, you get these photos of thick shaggy stipes, glistening with dew, and veil fragments hanging inches long from the margins of the cap.  And you never, ever see this, these are once in a lifetime type of shots.  I would be at group events, and there would be a small pile of these, but with smooth stipes and clean cap margins, and no one would say what they were.  I would say, oh those are S. ambigua, and they would open up the field guide, and point to the photo, and say, but they don&#8217;t look like this.  I would say, yes, yes, but they never ever look like that.</p>

But finally did get it under the scope, and got to the point where I am checking the radial section of the cap to see details of the cutis&#8230; and ooops, not a cutis.  These have a hymeniform pileipellis.   Dr. Desjardin looked at these, and said oh, yeah, not a Galerina.  It seems that Galerina won&#8217;t have a white stipe like this, or a membranous veil in the middle like that.</p>
<p>The micro shot is of the pileipellis (surface of the cap), at 400x under water, and this was a radial section.  This shows the hymeniform surface, with a series of cells pointing upward away from the surface in a single layer.  The cells apear colorless on a pigmented layer, and this creates the hygrophanous surface, as the cells dry out the light getting to the pigment changes.</p>
<p>So, unknown Conocybe here, a Galerina would not have this type of surface cells.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","Conecaps","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60654332","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97001380/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60654332,"Conocybe","Fungi",117228,0,0,"2007-11-12","2007-11-12","","UTC",703,703,"","","false",NA,"",734334,"2020-09-24 21:56:48 UTC","2020-09-24 21:57:01 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

<p>The first micro-shot is of a broken hyphae in Congo red at 1000&#215;.  Here you can see the connection between the cells in the hyphae, and there is no clamp connection.

<p>So, the question was between A. lobata and A. retiruga, and the clear difference between the two was that A. lobata has clamps, and A. retiruga does not.

<p>They are seprated by the fact that R. albida doesn&#8217;t have reticulation in the spores, and the cap surface is smooth, without cystidia.  R. basifurcata has reticulated spores, and lots of cystidia on the cap surface.</p>
<p>You can see that here in the micro-shots.  The first one is at 1000x with Meltzer&#8217;s reagent, and it is of a pair of spores.  The spores show amyloid reticulation, with kinda smallish warts.  The reticulation doesn&#8217;t seem complete, but it is clearly there.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is at 400x, under KOH, and this is of the cap surface.  The surface shows lots of cystidia as the hairy extensions.  I&#8217;m not sure still how to get the thickness of the cuticle from this.</p>

<p>It seems the features of a Hebeloma (if you really want to be sure because you just love little brown jobs&#8230;), are the dull brown spore color; the &#8220;bean&#8221; shaped spore that are &#8220;roughened&#8221;, not really warted; the lack of pleurocystidia;  and the fact that the cap surface cells are held in a gell, either as a &#8220;ixocutis&#8221; or an &#8220;ixotricoderm&#8221; (which mean that the surface cell lay along the cap surface, or stand up away from the surface).</p>
<p>The features that are most diagnostic is seems, is the presence of a fiberous veil or not; are the spore &#8220;snout&#8221; like, or rounded; the size and shape of the cheilocystidia; and the cells at the cap surface.  So, in the photos here, I have some old ones, and some young ones.  The young ones show the veil clearly.  Also the gills are pallid when young, and go brown in age.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is of the spores, at 1000x oil immersion, under Meltzer&#8217;s reagent.  This shows the &#8220;bean&#8221; like shape of the spores.  They are also variable in size.  But the average size is 8.5 &#215; 4.6 microns, measured from 12 spores.</p>
<p>The second shot is at 400x under Meltzer&#8217;s reagent.  This is of the gill edge, and show copious amounts of cystidia.  They seem to be in tight clumps, and some are slightly branched.</p>
<p>The third shot is of the cap surface cells, and this is at 400x under water.  I didn&#8217;t want to effect the color of the cells, or disolve the gell.  The suface cells break off and bend upwards, but they come from a tight layer in gell of cells running along the surface of the cap, so these are in an &#8220;ixocutis&#8221;.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t got back to the monograph of veiled Hebeloma with these details yet, but I think with these you can get a good id, or not&#8230;</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","Poisonpies","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60654015","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97000823/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60654015,"Hebeloma","Fungi",192716,0,0,"2007-11-04","2007-11-04","","UTC",703,703,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 21:53:21 UTC","2020-09-24 21:53:29 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

"Galerina semilanceata","2007-11-04 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Ok, after spending (wasting?) 3 hours in Smith and Singer&#8217;s 1964 monograph of Galerina of North America.  I think I have an id on these.  At least it keys out with some assumptions&#8230;</p>
<p>But the main feature turns out to be the shape of the cheilocystidia.  This is shown in the second micro-shot, which is a gill part (they kinda broke up when I was trying to mount a slice), at 400x under Meltzer&#8217;s.  The yellow cells are the basidia stained by the Meltzer&#8217;s, but the clear cells are the cystidia.  They are long, with a thin midsection, and a round bulb at the end.  The bulb makes the cystidia &#8220;capitate&#8221;, and this shape with the long thin section before the bulb was called &#8220;tibiiform&#8221; (which I have no idea what that means&#8230;).</p>
<p>Anyway, the first micro-shot is of the spores, this is at 400x under Meltzer&#8217;s.  The ave spore size for this guy was measures as 10.0 &#215; 5.8 microns, using 10 spores.  The spores should be roughened, in Galerina is genus is defined by the spores being covered with a tight &#8220;sack&#8221; that wears away in age.  This sack breaking up creates a loose rough surface to the spores, and a &#8220;plage&#8221;, a smooth spot on the end where the sack has completely pulled away.  These spores don&#8217;t show much roughness, or any distinct plage, but this is common in Galerina, where the sack doesn&#8217;t break up much.  Also there was no evidence of a germ pore, or I should say a germ pore was not observed.</p>
<p>The guys were found in a swampy deep moss covered area, which also seems to be common for Galerina, and a number of the species are only found here.  This species shows no veil, on the stipe or veil fragments on the cap.  The cap will be light tan to ocheracious (how ever you spell that), and the stipe should be concolorous with the cap.  There will be deep brown striations most of the way to the center, but will fade as the hygrophanous cap dries.</p>
<p>So, with all this, it does seem to key out in the monograph as G. tibiicystis.  Which seems to be one of the more common Galerina without a veil in moss covered swampy areas.  The only differences from the description is that the spore should be more roughened, here they were only slightly marbled at 1000&#215;.  And the stipe in the shots at the site show the stipe to lighter then the cap, and the cap to be more yellow.  But the shots at home against white paper show the tan colors, and stipe to be concolorous.  So, I&#8217;ll go with it.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60653899","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/97000596/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60653899,"Galerina semilanceata","Fungi",499815,0,0,"2007-11-04","2007-11-04","","UTC",703,703,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 21:51:43 UTC","2020-09-25 05:32:30 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"
