"Pogonomyrmex anzensis","2011-04-09 16:00:00 -0700","Note: added crop of image #1 showing 6-toothed mandibles.

<i>Semi-cryptic nest with approx. 6mm diameter entrance hole, on steep, rocky slope. Many P. anzensis workers foraging (Encelia sp. seeds). At least one worker was snared by unidentified spider. This was the most ‘obvious’ P. anzensis nest we found – others were completely (or almost completely) hidden under the edges of large rocks.

The following is from an info sheet I wrote in 2011:

The Anza Desert Harvester

Due to its unusual preference for steep, rocky habitat, this Pogo remained an enigma for four and half decades after its initial collection in 1952.

The limited known range of P. anzensis, coupled with the daunting terrain in which it is found, make this a rare Pogo indeed.

At the present time, P. anzensis is known definitively from only a few locations in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park (ABDP) in San Diego County, California USA.

Pogonomyrmex anzensis workers are red in color, and length is about 6.0mm (Taber 1998). They are easily distinguished from other Pogos in the area by their 6-toothed mandibles (as opposed to 7). Other distinctive features include the prominent, carinate rugae (ridges) adorning the occipital corners of the head, and a very visible ventral process on the postpetiole ('tooth-like' projection on the underside of the second part of the 'waist').

Nests of this ant are cryptic, especially among the jumbled, rock-strewn slopes where they are found. They consist of a single, small entrance hole sometimes adorned with a small apron of fine sand, or a tiny amount of almost invisible chaff (discarded plant material) (Snelling 2002). So far, these ants (and their nests) have only been found on west or southwest facing slopes; steep, and covered with large rocks (Snelling, Snelling, Schmidt and Cover 2009). This choice of habitat is unusual for Pogonomyrmex ants and is the reason this ant eluded searchers for so many years.

In April 2011, we (D.L. Quinn and T. Richter) located and photographed P. anzensis workers (and two nests) in the Pegleg Smith Monument area, on the border of ABDP and Borrego Springs, CA. Previously, a dead P. anzensis worker had been found in a spider web at this location (Snelling, Snelling, Schmidt and Cover 2009), so their presence here was suspected. At this location we observed foraging workers transporting seeds of brittlebush (Encelia sp.) and taking them into the nest. In addition to the Pegleg locality, we observed and imaged workers at the Ocotillo Wells Vehicular Recreation Area, a locality they were known to inhabit (Snelling, Snelling, Schmidt and Cover 2009).

We noted (as have others) that the workers of this species are very docile – no aggressive or defensive behaviors were elicited when photographing these ants. We did observe workers running around frantically in response to spider predation, however. 

Special thanks to Gordon C. Snelling for information and advice regarding Pogonomyrmex anzensis. (DLQ Loc: 071)</i>

*** Edited Nov 22, 2017 ***

Previously identified as Foothills yellow-legged frogs, some have pointed out they may be juvenile bullfrogs. 

I am (or was) only a brief visitor to the area in 2011 and did not have a chance to take a closer look at the individuals or get more detailed photographs. 

Given I had no previous experience with the species (R. boylii), I will take the cautious approach and leave the ID open to further input from the i-naturalist community.

I first became aware of this nest on 4/17, when I heard a pair of Hutton's Vireos quietly talking to each other; one also sang a few times.  Eventually, I saw one of them carrying a piece of fine grass or something similar in its bill (perhaps rattlesnake grass?).  I followed the pair and watched them go to a certain spot in a live oak.  Next, I saw a vireo take a fluffy white feather up to the same spot. Then lichens? Overall, I saw them carry various nesting materials at least 4 times.  They always went up to the same spot and seemed to be arranging things in the nest; though I'm not sure if it was just one of the vireos doing the nest-building or both.  The nest was a relatively small cup, covered with lichen on the outside.  It was still occupied on 4/28 (adult sitting on nest), but had apparently failed by 5/13.  As far as I could tell, the fluffy, white lining had been pulled out of the nest a bit, and some was even scattered on the surrounding vegetation.

"Batrachoseps attenuatus","2011-04-16 14:09:00 -0400","The California slender salamander (Batrachoseps attenuatus) is a lungless salamander[2] that is found primarily in coastal mountain areas of Northern California, United States as well as in a limited part of the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada, California, in patches of the northern Central Valley of California, and in extreme southwestern Oregon. What makes this amphibian notable is that this species resides primarily in a limited range within California as one of a handful quasi-endemic amphibians in the state.

In 2001, it was reported that, on behalf of the National Park Service, Professor David Wake and his graduate students found that the California slender salamander, the most common salamander in California, was in fact twenty separate species spread out along the coast from Oregon to Mexico.[3] Presently, the California slender salamander is viewed as one of the nineteen species of the genus Batrachoseps, each of which is characterized by four toes on each foot. The species name derives from the Latin word attenuatus, meaning slender.[4]","big basin",37.1657737,-122.2256803,"","California Slender Salamander","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/14667","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/28670/medium.jpg","briangratwicke",14667,"California Slender Salamander","Amphibia",27459,1,0,"April 16, 2011 14:09","2011-04-16","2011-04-16 18:09:00 UTC","Eastern Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","open","false",NA,NA,3406,"2011-04-17 16:30:45 UTC","2016-03-01 20:07:29 UTC","research","CC-BY",NA,NA,"false"

Before commercial logging and clearing began by the 1850s, this massive tree occurred naturally in an estimated 2.1 million acres along much of coastal California (excluding southern California where rainfall is not abundant enough) and the southwestern corner of coastal Oregon within the United States.","big basin",37.1657737,-122.2256803,"","coast redwood","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/14659","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/28662/medium.jpg","briangratwicke",14659,"Sequoia sempervirens","Plantae",47372,2,0,"April 16, 2011 14:11","2011-04-16","2011-04-16 18:11:00 UTC","Eastern Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false",NA,NA,3406,"2011-04-17 16:15:05 UTC","2018-02-08 18:28:13 UTC","research","CC-BY",NA,NA,"false"
