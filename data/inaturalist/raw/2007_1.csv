"Fungi","2007-01-10 00:00:00 +0000","<p>I believe these were brought in with a bunch of stuff from a foray to Monterey for stuff before the fair.  Looked to be some pine forest, and lots of stuff from pine needle duff.  These were part of a bunch of them, maybe 20 caps brought in.  Some quite large, stipes 10-12 cm long, 1-1.5 cm wide, caps of 4-8 cm in diameter. On the tops of some stipes could be seen grey-brown spore prints.  The caps were radially fibrous and dry.  No distinctive odor.</p>
<p>But other than that, I&#8217;ve no idea what they are&#8230;</p>
<p>3/8/2008 &#8211; Getting back to these guys.  They suggest Psathyrella, but I&#8217;m not sure, and the spore don&#8217;t look right.  The spores have a grey-brown color, which is ok.  But as far as I can tell Psathyrella should have smooth spores with a germ pore, and are dark.  These spores do not have a germ pore.</p>
<p>The first micro-shot is at 1000x in Meltzers, and is of a few spores from the gill.  The spores are lightly grey, no germ pore, and it doesn&#8217;t come out in the photo, but lightly dimpled, like a golf ball.  What this suggestion, I&#8217;ve no idea.</p>
<p>The second micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Metlzers.  This displays some cheilocystidia.</p>
<p>The third shot is of the pileipellis, which is a cutis without gelatin, which isn&#8217;t a surprise given the look of the shrooms.</p>
<p>The forth micro-shot is of the gill and pileus at 100x in Metlzers, and I shot this just to add another fact to the mix, that the lamellar trama is dextrinoid.</p>
<p>So, putting this together, I&#8217;ve got nothing.  It doesn&#8217;t look like a Psathyrella, but I have no idea what it does look like.</p>
<p>Anyone have an idea here, to try and get these to genus?</p>
<p>Looking through Mushrooms to Genus VI, Largent and Baroni, I&#8217;ve still got nothing.  Doesn&#8217;t seem to match anything there in the end.  The closest I get is Melanomphalia, but those are supposed to be small, with decurrent gills.  So, you got me what these are.</p>

"Helotiales","2007-01-27 00:00:00 +0000","<p>These were kinda neat, I saw this yellow patch down on the edge of the duff, it was on the end of a rotting D. fir branch, right up against the rotting log.  At first I just though slime mold, but cute, so why not.  I grabbed the branch, and it broke up into pieces.  In the forest the yellow patch was pretty damp, and it was a dull yellow, and kinda gushy, still didn&#8217;t know if it was slime mold.</p>
<p>Later back at the ranch, the little guys started to dry out a bit, the yellow became brighter.  Also the small caps started to firm up, and pulled away from the branch, and showed little stipes underneath.</p>
<p>So, these are little asci&#8217;s, on short little stipes.  I thought I might have seen them before, but I checked my records, and what I saw before had a fuzzy exterior with a dark ring around each cap.  These are smooth on the edges, and smooth underneath that small caps.</p>
<p>No idea what these are, but cute little guys.  I think Debbie Veiss took away a sample.</p>
<p>Feb. 23 2007 &#8212; Just got &#8220;Mushrooms of Colorado&#8221;, by V. Evenson (1997), and I was looking through it, and right at the end of the asci&#8217;s were these little yellow puffy guys on rotting wood.  Looking at the google images for this species, these match exactly.  There is even an image by Dimtar, and he was there&#8230; but anyway.  Dennis mentioned Rutstroemia, which are these little clustered cups, but with clear dark stipes.  These don&#8217;t really have the clear dark stipe of Rutstroemia, they are just centrally attached in the back.

<p>These have a mild taste, yellow gills, plain white stipe, and bright red cap.  The stipes of these were also somewhat wrinkled along the length, and stuffed.  Also there was a really old one, and the stipe was dull grey on that one.  When I cut one open the flesh stained grey quickly as you can see in the second photo.</p>
<p>These all seem to point to R. occidentalis, but also to R. pacifica.  R. pacifica was only seen under Sitka spruce in the north of the state, so it is probably R. occidentalis.  But the staining reaction of that one is it turned red first, and then grey later when cut.  I don&#8217;t see much red there, but there is some light reddish tone in the edge of the stipe, maybe&#8230;  so I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>The talk on Saturday of this foray was by Dr. Terry Hinkel of Humboldt State University, and it was about wood rotting fungus, most of which seem to be polypores.  Anyway, there are different types of wood rotters, eating away at different parts of the wood.  These are heart wood rotters, which go after the cellulose in the interior dead wood at the heart of the tree.  Once the cellolose is gone, only the brown lignin is left, which loses all strength, and becomes crumbly.  But also with heart wood rotters, there are top rotters, and but rotters.  The top rotters go after the heart wodd from the top of the tree, and the but rotters go after it from the base.  These are top rotters, and the fruitings of these are only at the tops of trees.  But as they rot out the center of the tree, it weakens, and eventually breaks off in the wind.  Then you get to find infected branches lying on the forst floor, and the fruiting bodies.</p>","Albion, Mendocino Co., California, USA",39.22805,-123.758,"","Rosy Conk","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60646790","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/96989230/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60646790,"Rhodofomes cajanderi","Fungi",764105,0,0,"2007-01-27","2007-01-27","","UTC",2230,2230,"","","false",NA,NA,734334,"2020-09-24 20:41:30 UTC","2020-09-24 20:41:32 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

<p>But these are nice colorful really little guys.  The stature and shape of a small Marasmius, or Mycena, but the color and feel of a Hygrocybe.  Maybe these are listed in Largent&#8217;s Hygrophorus section of Agricales of CA?  Or are they a Mycena?</p>
<p>Feb 23, 2007 &#8212; ok, after going through Hygrophoraceae section of Agaricales of CA, by Dr. D. L. Largent, I think I have it, or as close as I can get.  This is, or is very close to Hygrophorus minutulus.  Other close ones are H. subminutulus which is the same but with smaller spores, so it might be that.  H. reai which is almost the same, but with a very bitter taste.  I didn&#8217;t get the taste, so it might be that.  But it is listed as very rare only found once by D. Desjardin.  H. mollis seems to be larger. more yellow, and becomes squamulose when dry.  These stay smooth.  And finally H. marchii, which has a collybioid shape and is larger.  Also H. minutulus is the only one that says probably common, but overlooked do to its small size.  It also says it is found in northern redwood forests, but since Largent is from up the Humboldt way, I will assume he means that&#8217;s where he finds them&#8230; in any case none of these state they are under live oak and Ca. bay, which is where I found these.  (except H. reai was found under D. fir anf Ca. bay, I should have seen if they are bitter, than this would be the second find of them&#8230;)  So, I am going with the one which is listed as common.</p>
<p>They are different than H. miniatus (H. miniata depending if you like Hygrophorus or Hygrocybe&#8230;), in that those are centrally flat or depressed, and the cap has yellow squamules when dry, and also with a larger stature.

"Russula basifurcata","2007-01-21 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Ok not completely sure about the id on this one, but it seems to be the closest I can get to.  This is russula, with very yellow gills, an off-white/yellow cap color, and mild taste.</p>
<p>The mild taste and yellow gills put into one class of Russula, by Thiers&#8217; Russula section of the Agaricales of CA.  Having a off-white/yellow cap seems to id it as either: R. flaviceps, R. albida, and R. basifurcata.  R. basifurcata is only in the mountains right after the spring snow melt, so its not that one.  R. flaviceps is supposed to be bright &#8220;intense&#8221; lemon-yellow, pretty much all over.  This one is yellow, but I wouldn&#8217;t say it is &#8220;intense&#8221; lemon-yellow.  So, that leaves me R. albida.</p>
<p>Which it seems to match the discription fairly well, except: the stipe is too short (no biggy), it is listed as being found in the coastal areas of Marin and Mendocino Counties (which I guess is close enough really), and the stipe in the discription is hollow to stuffed &#8212; this stipe was solid, really solid and firm.  R. flaviceps has a solid stipe, but differs in the other discriptions.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to be at the Fungus Fair in Santa Cruz on Sunday (Jan 14th), and hope to spend some time with this sample and perhaps get a better id.</p>
<p>1/29/2007 &#8211; Ok, now think this is a dried out T. manazanitae after comparing the fresh version to description in Agaracales of CA.  But since this one is so dried out it is still a little uncertain here.</p>
<p>This one is too dried out to probably tell anything about.  But one thing, T. manzanitae in the discription says the lanellae should be dull yellow in age, where here they are brown.  And T. dryophilum the lamellae stain brown in age.</p>

The gills also show color variation, which seems to be linked to age.  Starts bright white, and then the gills darken to light grey, and then darker grey with blackish stains.</p>
<p>At the Santa Cruz Fungus Fed. setup for the Fair on this weekend (Jan 13-14), I got into a discussion about why these aren&#8217;t T. portentosum.  You have to read Kris Shanks notes on this species for that question.

It looks like there are male and female flowers on the flower spike, with the female flowers uppermost and developing into fruit. These are also notably ant plants, with ants visiting the extrafloral nectaries and small &quot;buds&quot; at the tips of the young leaves (presumably rich in fats). I haven't noticed ants on this plant species in New Zealand. I'll look closer now.
