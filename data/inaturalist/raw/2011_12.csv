They were roosting on the cave walls. After I saw them,  I slowly raised my flashlight up, took a few pictures, and then slowly dropped the light. The bats didn't move and an hour later were still in the same place. 

Their identification was based on their very long ears (folded back), long, sharp tragus, and the raised glands on either side of their noses.","San Benito County, US-CA, US",36.4316196793,-121.2902387991,"","Townsend's Big-eared Bat","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/1645323","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/2018627/medium.jpg","rjadams55",1645323,"Corynorhinus townsendii","Mammalia",74205,1,0,"2011-12-02","2011-12-02","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",178,10000,"","obscured","true",NA,"",108450,"2015-06-18 20:10:54 UTC","2016-07-11 20:56:26 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

"Liquidambar styraciflua","2011-12-02 00:00:00 -0800","Liquidambar has to be one of the most widely planted trees in Oakland and also one of the most troublesome. Every rainy season I witness dozens of these trees losing large limbs, or entire trees falling down. I figure Oakland plants them cause they do well in the cityscape and are drought tolerant. Still, when the rain comes the trees with cuts or injuries soak up the water into their heartwood turning it into a pulpy mush. Pulpy mush not being the most structurally sound material the weight of the tree or limb comes crashing down. They are also a untidy tree laying down tons of small spiked capsules which can be dangerous on concrete sidewalks as they roll under your feet.

"Lontra canadensis","2011-12-11 00:00:00 -0800","I had great fun watching a river otter this afternoon (12/11/11) at Healdsburg Ridge Open Space Preserve. It spent much of an hour energetically swimming around Fox Pond in pursuit of food, occasionally going to shore to feast on its unfortunate victims. I just loved tracking its underwater movement by following the trail of air bubbles, and hearing its inhalations during brief trips to the surface. The highlight was watching it chow down on a big fish - I could even hear crunching! What a treat!!  It was at the pond yesterday as well.

Update (1/13/12):  Saw the river otter at Fox Pond today, my first time visiting the pond since I first reported the otter back in December.  I heard it was there a week after I reported it as well.  I'm surprised it hasn't exhausted its food supply yet.  It was eating something when I arrived, but it soon disappeared.","Healdsburg Ridge Open Space Preserve, Healdsburg, CA",38.6402128565,-122.859147191,"Sonoma County","North American River Otter","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/42140","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/69648/medium.jpg","emilyheaton",42140,"North American River Otter","Mammalia",41777,3,0,"2011-12-11","2011-12-11","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","open","false",NA,NA,1203,"2011-12-12 05:03:26 UTC","2018-06-21 16:12:43 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
