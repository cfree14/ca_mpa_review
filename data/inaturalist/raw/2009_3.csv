<p>These fruited in two different locations on campus simultanously, both under redwood.  The first specimen was in a <span class=""caps"">VERY</span> dark spot, hard against the inner part of an large, burned-out redwood stump surrounded by a dense group of smaller redwoods.  2-3 other species of <a href=""http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/lookup_name/Leptonia""><i>Leptonia</i></a> were found under this same tree.</p>","California, US",36.8300263862,-122.1052969617,"","","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/3547219","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/4132230/medium.","leptonia",3547219,"Leptonia carnea","Fungi",67387,2,0,"2009-03-05","2009-03-05","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",1753,28476,"","obscured","true","","",5179,"2016-06-29 15:42:11 UTC","2020-06-11 05:02:07 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

<p>The stipe is described by Largent as blue-grey; in these specimens, the stipe was evenly grey with no trace of blue (this is important when the pileus is young and blue-black, thus resembling many other <a href=""http://mushroomobserver.org/observer/lookup_name/Leptonia""><i>Leptonia</i></a>).</p>
