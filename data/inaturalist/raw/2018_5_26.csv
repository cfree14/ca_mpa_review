Repeats about every 2 seconds, from one bat, others also chirp.  this morning there seemed to be a number of them, chirps coming from every direction, too rapidly for one bat to move position. 
Time: Most active from midnight to just before dawn, but I heard them early evening one night. They've been in my neighborhood since May 20, 2018, active every night.
Location: Sounds come from above me, growing louder then fainter as they pas by, moving south to north, or opposite way.  
Habitat: Residential hillside area, grassy slopes with numerous tall trees, pine, ash, palm, Southern California Walnut & others, shrubs, houses, open space. 

Haven't seen them, only hear them moving in the air.","Division St, Los Angeles 90065",34.11384,-118.222555,NA,"Bats","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/12843283","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/18634654/medium.jpg","crayonsss",12843283,"Bats","Mammalia",40268,0,0,"2018-05-26","2018-05-26","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",30,30,"","","false","","",164021,"2018-05-27 00:07:01 UTC","2018-05-30 16:16:03 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

Just to note, neither of these two spices are present along the trails accent from the rcc side of the hill. There was no acorns or acorn caps present. Photo #2 shows the various sizes and shapes of the mature leaves. Photo #3 is the under side of a leaf. Mature leave a measured from and inch to two and a half inches, many with very pronounced spines. Bark was grey and smooth. Last photo shows young leaf growth. I am unable to ID. Fairly  certain this is a type of scrub oak but with the size and shape of the leaves I wonder if these were hybrids or even planted at some point. I plan to check the other peaks in the area and see if I can find any more and If they are similar in appearance.","Moreno Valley, CA 92555, USA",33.874536138,-117.1910325252,"","oaks","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/12832212","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/18615414/medium.jpeg","mharvey87",12832212,"oaks","Plantae",47851,0,0,"2018-05-26 9:18:48 AM PDT","2018-05-26","2018-05-26 16:18:48 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",7,7,"","","false","","",756447,"2018-05-26 18:00:25 UTC","2018-05-27 20:50:38 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,2,"false"
