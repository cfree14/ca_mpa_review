I think this is L. latifolius, given the broad leaves with small numbers of leaflets, relative lack of hairiness, and streamside habitat.  Other possibilities are L. albicaulis &amp; L. microcarpus var. densiflorus. L. latifolius var. columbianus and L. albicaulis both have single herbarium records from Kings Canyon; those are the only decent matches anywhere in the area.

I think I'm just about to give up on amateur attempts to ID photos of 'difficult' taxa via Jepson Manual descriptions plus herbarium records.  Seems like I'm likely to get it wrong as often as to get it right!
