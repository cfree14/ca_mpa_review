"Tricholoma","2006-10-11 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Ok, these are not from Stanford Campus, but from the general area, so maybe close enough.  I didn&#8217;t find these, and don&#8217;t know where they come from, they were brought into the Santa Cruz Fungus Fair setup, and kinda confused people for a little while.  But they are well described in Arora, and he has a note about these with the green tones.  I think from other places these are more just orange and tan, but ones in this region have these olive green colors.  The orangish beads at the top of the stipe are also described in Arora.</p>
<p>The night was too busy with mushroom sorting, so I wasn&#8217;t able to setup for photos.  But these were so unique, and I hadn&#8217;t seen them before, that I had to get a shot off.  I was able to white balance on the paper plate, which was white enough, so the colors turned out pretty well here.</p>
<p>Well, went back to the Fungus Fair on Sunday, Jan. 14th, to help man the ID table, and sat there for 6 hours behind a sign saying &#8220;Ask me about Mushrooms&#8221;.  Talking a lot about mushrooms once things got going around 11am, I hope I made some sort of sense at least once in awhile&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, nearby was the Tricholoma table, and these mushrooms were out there, labelled in their own basket.  But the neat thing about them by this point, was that the green had faded quite a bit.  At this point you would say these were orangish mushrooms with hints of green, where on Wed. here you would say these are greenish mushrooms with hints of orange.  It seems that the amount of green in the mushroom depends on how fresh and moist they are.</p>","Menlo Park, California, USA",37.44215,-122.1845,"","Knights","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60645825","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/96987718/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60645825,"Tricholoma","Fungi",62484,0,0,"2006-10-11","2006-10-11","","UTC",4891,4891,"","","false",NA,"",734334,"2020-09-24 20:32:09 UTC","2020-09-24 20:32:12 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

The ovipositing pair drops eggs by shaking them off one at a time from a height of about two feet above the dried mud of the pond margins. I’ve also observed females ovipositing solo at heights up to 4-5 feet. I’ve seen the males lose interest and leave the female, and I’ve seen the female refuse to continue ovipositing, shake off the male, grab a perch and refuse to move. The pair shown here actually did that and the male then head-bumped his resting mate as if to encourage her to get back to the business of dropping eggs. On this date I estimated there were 100+ coupled pairs and another 200+ single males at the dried-up west end of this pond.","MB05 Pond, Monte Bello Open Space Preserve, Santa Clara County, CA, USA",37.3194476647,-122.1852067842,"","Striped Meadowhawk","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/22253949","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/34458628/medium.jpeg","instar",22253949,"Striped Meadowhawk","Insecta",113521,1,0,"2006/10/25 1:41 PM PDT","2006-10-25","2006-10-25 20:41:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",163,163,"","","false",NA,"",1443166,"2019-04-09 20:46:26 UTC","2019-12-22 22:07:07 UTC","research","CC-BY",NA,NA,"false"
