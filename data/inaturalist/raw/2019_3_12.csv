The Presidio Trust IPM Team swabbed the animal for WNV and CDFW is performing a necropsy. Last year a DOA GHO was found in the park and CDFW concluded electrocution. This is not the male of the celebrity pair currently under the Presidio Trust Raptor Cam...

Follow up after necropsy: Adult male in breeding condition. He had abundant fat reserves and well-developed pectoral muscles. There was generalized organ pallor (anemia) and unexplained bleeding on the feet. He tested positive for 3 second generation anticoagulant rodenticides: Brodifacoum, Bromadialone, and Difethialone with Brodifacoum and Bromadialone at toxic levels. Cause of death is anticoagulant rodenticide toxicosis. 

Anticoagulant rodenticide exposure rates in raptors we receive for necropsy is generally high because these products are so widely used. Statewide for great horned owls exposure is around 92% and for red-tailed hawks exposure is around 75%. Exposure rates are generally higher in areas with more people since those are the areas that tend to have a higher concentration of rodents (house mice, Norway rats).

Second generation anticoagulant rodenticides are restricted use in California, meaning they must be applied by a certified applicator or pest company. Predators and scavengers are secondarily exposed when they feed on rodents that have ingested the bait or on other animals that have fed on rodents.  Education, awareness and outreach continues...

My best guess is that the bigger salamander, which is the focus of this observation may be a neotenic adult from the previous year? I watched it munch one of the little guys just before this series of photos, you can see the tail coming out of its mouth in one pic.
These critters are in a small cement lined pond behind my house within the redwood forest. It fills with rainwater and I occasionally add water in the summer so that it doesn't dry out. There are a few goldfish in it too, though they are mostly there as indicators of water quality.

Then there is this one: flowers are tan, stem height is 10 cm, stems diameter smaller.  Are these 2 species? Subspecies? Two growth forms based upon soils?  I am curious!!! 
I plan to consult a USFS botanist and I will report what I find out.

Thanks to garmanb0zia's assist.

Cap size and color match L. percevalii on Pp121 of ""Mushrooms of the Redwood Coast"".  These have the rather pointed umbo also, along with partial veil remnants on margin.
Spore print is purplish grey. Sipe:  long , slender and twisted.
Living in mulch.

Not many other mushtooms out these days; not even Amanita, Russula, Suillus, or Helvella (our regulars here in the forest.)
