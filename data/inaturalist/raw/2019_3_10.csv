Scutellinia scutellata is apparently a catch-all designation for several related species of cup fungi that are poorly studied and therefore poorly understood.  As a group, however, they are fairly distinctive.  Key traits are the cup or disc-like shape, orange to deep orange-red color, and hairy margin of the cap.

Overall dimensions:  The largest of these cup fungi was approximately 1 cm in diameter.

"Lynx rufus","2019-03-10 00:00:00 -0800","We saw a beautiful bobcat in our front yard in Thousand Oaks (near Hillcrest and Conejo School Road).  It was on Sunday 3/10 at 6:30 PM.  The bobcat was walking down our long driveway (we live on a flag lot next to a large open space).  My daughters heard our driveway motion sensor go off and they looked out our front window.  They were so excited and said ""Mom, Dad, there's a REALLY BIG CAT in our front yard!!)  We raced over to the window and saw the bobcat.  He was gorgeous and he had a tracking collar around his neck.  I found out later when I talked to Joanne Moriarty, that it was ""Bobcat B363.""  She told me they caught him after the November fires and he weighed 22 lbs.  He squeezed through our metal fencing and went to our HOA park where he sat down in front of a large tree.  He basically camoflauged himself.  At that point, we went outside to take a closer look at him.  We stared at him through the gate and he stared right back at us.  We stayed far enough away to not be a threat to him or for him to be a threat to us.  We were so excited to be in his presence!  We had our cell phones with us so we took photos but it was dusk and the photo quality is not good.  I'm sharing the pictures anyway but I wish we were able to get better images.  We were in awe of that beautiful creature and we hope he was able to find whatever food he was looking for (there are bunnies and squirrels everywhere).  We hope to see him again sometime.  It was a magical experience for us and I'm happy to take part in any studies about bobcats.

"Calymmaria sierra","2019-03-10 13:37:00 -0700","This adult male was found outside my house and was collected to confirm its ID. 

ID was based on it being an ecribellate, entelegyne with three claws and eight eyes in two rows. There is a row of trichobothria on the tarsi that increase in length distally. The spinneret pattern matched members of the family Hahniidae and there was a mixture of teeth and denticles on the cheliceral retromargin. The long, slender legs are consistent with the genus Calymmaria. 

It was ID'd to species using the architecture of its reproductive structure as outlined in Heiss & Draney's 2004 paper ""Revision of the Nearctic Spider Genus Calymmaria (Araneae, Hahniidae).
