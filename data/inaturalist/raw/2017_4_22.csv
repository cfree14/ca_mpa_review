"Ranunculus andersonii","2017-04-22 11:32:04 -0700","pink buttercup, Beckwithia andersonii (=Ranunculus andersonii), California, White Mountains, Black Mountain, Owens Valley drainage, elevation 2406 m (7895 ft).

Finally got up high enough, early enough in the season, and in a wet enough season to see these for myself in the White Mountains.  They have been known from this location for a long time, but most of the time only as a few crispy brown leaves.  They bloom early and fast as the snow melts, and if you miss those few weeks, they are gone again.  This is the only place they have been found in the White Mountains, although a lot of similar (but less accessible) habitat exists in the surrounding area.

This distinctive buttercup is a regional endemic to the sagebrush and pinyon-juniper zones of the Great Basin and immediately adjacent areas of the interior western United States, at elevations of 900-2900 meters (3000-9500 feet).  It is generally found on open upland slopes and flats, but usually where the spring snow pack is a bit more persistent.  The petals start off white but quickly age pinkish to red.

Recent DNA studies have suggested that this species is different enough from most other buttercups to belong in a separate genus, Beckwithia.  I include both names here until there is more consensus one way or the other.

This subspecies, characterized by the fringe of hairs on its tiny petals, is endemic to the southern Great Basin desert of south-central Nevada and adjacent California and Utah.  Within that area this perennial member of the carrot family is locally common on dry slopes at middle elevation, but is easy to miss unless you are looking for it soon after the snow melts.  In the driest years it may not emerge at all, instead staying dormant as a long deep root under the surface.

Also visible in this image is a leaf of sego lily (Calochortus bruneaunis).

Other Common Names
Buffalo Gnats

Explanation of Names
Simuliidae Newman 1834
BUFFALO GNAT may refer to the hump-backed appearance or to feeding on buffalo

Numbers
255 spp. in 13 genera in NA north of Mexico, &gt;100 species in Canada; &gt;2100 spp. in 35 genera total

Size
1-5.5 mm(3)

Identification
Adult: black to various shades of gray or yellow; thorax shiny, strongly convex, giving a humpbacked, gnat-like appearance; wings clear, broad, without hairs or scales; heavy veins near anterior wing margin, weak veins posteriorly; small head with large round eyes and short 11-segmented antennae; ocelli lacking
Larva: brown, gray, or black with light brown head; body cylindrical, somewhat club-shaped; head with prominent pair of mouth brushes used for filtering food from the water

Identification to genus is often difficult, except that clearly marked flies, with leg bands, scutal stripes, or abdominal spots, are typically in genus Simulium.
The family can be divided into three monophyletic groups based on wing veins. Parasimulium (endemic to Pacific Northwest) has R1 terminating near the midpoint of the wing. Tribe Prosimuliini has Rs forked with the fork at least as long as the stem. Tribe Simuliini has Rs unforked or with a very short fork at the end.

Range
worldwide, most diverse in Eurasia and the Neotropics; in NA, widespread but more diverse and abundant in the north
Habitat
larvae develop in running water of all types, from the smallest seepages and streams to the largest rivers and waterfalls; they attach themselves to underwater rocks and other objects by means of small hooklets in a sucker-like disc at the tip of the abdomen

Season
Adults may be present spring through fall but usually for a shorter duration in a specific location, depending on species and latitude. A few southern species fly in winter.

Food
larvae filter small aquatic organisms and detritus from flowing water; adults of many species feed on the blood of birds; a number of species do not take blood meals; only a few species attack humans, usually when a more suitable host is not available

Life Cycle
most northern species have one generation per year; some species have multiple generations; overwinters as either an egg or a larva, depending on species and/or latitude

Remarks
Black flies attack most severely about sunrise and at sunset -- either massively and viciously or in such small numbers that they are scarcely noticeable. They bite painlessly so that you may not be aware of having been attacked until small droplets of blood start oozing from your skin. Black flies often crawl into your hairline or through openings in your clothes before they bite you. Therefore, the bites are usually behind your ears, around your neck and beltline, and on the lower parts of your legs. A typical bite consists of a round, pink, itchy swollen area, with a droplet of fresh or dried blood at the center. When the blood is rubbed away, a minute subcutaneous hemorrhage is visible. This hemorrhage and the surrounding pink area become diffuse and larger, and then disappear within a few days. Itching may continue intermittently for weeks, whenever the bitten area is rubbed. Scratching may cause severe secondary skin infections. Toxins injected during an extended severe attack can cause a general illness sometimes called black-fly fever, characterized by headache, fever, nausea, and swollen, painful neck glands. Attacks occur throughout late spring and early summer (sometimes throughout the summer).
often ranked third worldwide among arthropods in importance as disease vectors, but only ~10-20% of the world's spp. are pests of humans/livestock.

"Stachys","2017-04-22 11:15:43 -0700","California hedge-nettle, sometimes called wood mint, is a common slender annual with an erect square stem that rises from a procumbent base to a height of 2-1/2'.  The hairs on the angles of the stem are stiff and reflexed, those on the sides are soft and glandular.  The flowers appear in separate whorls with six flowers in each whorl.  The corolla is 1/2"" long, two-lipped with the lower twice as long as the upper, and pink to light-purplish with 4 exserted stamens.  The calyx is hairy and 5-toothed, the teeth triangular and spine-tipped.  The leaves of this hedge nettle are ovate to oblong-ovate to 7"" long and opposite with scalloped edges and a subcordate base.  This species inhabits moist to dryish slopes and partially-shaded canyons to 4000' (mostly below 1500') in chaparral and coastal sage scrub from Orange Co. north, and blooms from April to September.  California hedge nettle is not one of the stinging nettles and has a pleasant lemon scent when rubbed.

"Ammophila aberti","2017-04-22 08:30:00 -0700","Bright red abdomen with distinctive black mark on upper surface. Thorax is silver, but black on top. Silver head with black eyes. Overall length 20mm.

Always seen in a group of a dozen or more flying a few inches above the ground in an area as wide as the trail and 20-30 feet long.

They dig small perfectly circular holes. They don't stack up the excavated dirt (tailings). They fly a short distance from the opening, then scatter the tailings and return for more. For this reason, I believe this is Ammophila procera.

Other ammophila wasp species stack the tailings nearby, but they don't fly there. They walk.

 When the hole is complete, they paralyze and drag prey into the hole, then carefully fill it with nearby dirt. They brush the filled hole with their forelegs, leaving no sign that there was a hole.

Easy to spend an hour watching them.","Sycamore Canyon Canyon Springs, Riverside, CA, USA",33.937955,-117.3104683333,"Wasps & Bees","Abert's Thread-waisted Wasp","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/5915725","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/7379318/medium.jpg","ericjorgensen",5915725,"Ammophila aberti","Insecta",313038,2,0,"2017/04/22 8:30 AM PDT","2017-04-22","2017-04-22 15:30:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false","","",54001,"2017-04-23 02:13:50 UTC","2021-12-20 05:28:03 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
