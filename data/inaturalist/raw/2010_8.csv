Note that this animal has 6 yellow tubercles, 3 on each side of the dorsum between the rhinophores and the branchial plume. A specimen was found at the LA County of Natural History with these same yellow tubercles mixed with a lot of Doriopsilla albopunctata. That specimen had oral tentacles, so presumably this individual also has oral tentacles. This feature excludes this animal from the genus Doriopsilla. It is possible that this is Baptodoris mimetica if the feature of these yellow tubercles is sometimes present and other times absent in this species, but I suggest that anatomical and DNA study be performed before identifying this animal as B. mimetica. The other possibility is that this is an undescribed rare yellow dorid that mimics D. albopunctata, D. fulva and B. mimetica.","San Pedro, Los Angeles, CA, USA",33.7109466201,-118.3179906622,"Baptodoris mimetica, slug","Mimic Dorid","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/66716049","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/107602804/medium.jpg","craigahoover",66716049,"Mimic Dorid","Mollusca",48748,2,0,"2010/08/14 1:52 PM PDT","2010-08-14","2010-08-14 20:52:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",203,203,"","","false","","",2100377,"2020-12-17 23:55:17 UTC","2021-01-07 17:50:12 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

We were looking for Alligator Lizards when this good sized dog appeared out of of the scrub. 
It was a large dog with odd looking eyes. My initial reaction was Coydog given its odd appearance but actual Coydogs are rare or so I have read. 
I could very well be just a large feral domestic dog too. I saw no collar and it was extremely shy. 
I would love to get any opinions about this odd looking feral dog.
