"Larus hyperboreus","2013-12-22 11:03:00 -0600","Presumably same enormous gull first reported earlier in the week, then re-found for the Oceanside CBC.

We re-re-found the bird on 22-Dec-13 at approx. 10:00am in the slackwater pool at the mouth of San Luis Rey River, Oceanside (San Diego Co.) Calif.  It then followed us (or vice versa) over to the beach just north of the rock jetty, where this photo was taken at 11:03am.

The body and head of this specimen are light brownish-buff, running to pure white on the chin and around the base of bill; duskier around the wee, beady eyes. Pale brown streaks on the head.  Back is pale buff, with pale brown wavy bars. Tail quite plain, with light pattern of whitish and buff bars. Bill is fleshy pink with square-cut black tip. The legs are fairly bright pink/flesh-colored. Pure white primaries.

"Quercus wislizeni frutescens","2013-12-06 00:00:00 -0800","This specimen fits the species description very well, except for the hairiness of the leaves. (Notice the tiny hairs on the upper and lower surfaces of the leaf blade. They are approximately 0.1-0.2 mm long.) <a href=""http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233501098"">Flora of North America</a> describes the leaf blade surfaces as ""abaxially and adaxially glabrous."" The <a href=""http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_IJM.pl?tid=64776"">second edition of the Jepson Manual</a> also agrees with this description.

After looking at specimens from the Jepson and UC Berkeley Herbarium, I decided that they didn't literally mean glabrous, but rather that the leaf blades <b>appear</b> glabrous.

Specimen numbers UC1135915, UC1135903, UC848384, UC1135900, UC5830 were particularly helpful in making my identification. All five specimens were confirmed by John Tucker as Q. wislizeni var. frutescens and shared similar leaf characteristics as my specimen.","Buckeye Heliport, Sierra National Forest, Fresno, California, United States",37.049287,-119.394101,"","Bush Interior Live Oak","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/504170","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/641740/medium.jpg","belinda",504170,"Quercus wislizeni frutescens","Plantae",58914,1,0,"2013-12-06","2013-12-06","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false","","",8755,"2014-01-18 20:47:10 UTC","2014-10-20 13:21:38 UTC","research","CC-BY",NA,NA,"false"

I saw the sapsucker about 3 feet up an oak trunk just 5 feet from the street near Memorial Park.  My presence made it fly off, but it returned to the same tree in a few minutes.  Seems to be a juvenile molting into adult plumage - the scapular parts and lower back were brownish, with obvious white wing patch and white/pale tips on wing feathers.  Head showed complicated black and white pattern with red crown, all-white throat visible in photo which distinguishes it from female red-naped sapsucker;  this bird is lacking the black bib i would expect in a full adult female.

""Jim, that looks like a Golden Eagle. You can see the tail is mostly white with a dark terminal band, and that the secondaries also have some white mottling within them; both of these are good marks for an immature GOEA. Also, the wings are very long, with extremely long primaries. The tail is proportionally a bit longer and a bit narrower than the tail of a Red-tail.""

"Enteroctopus dofleini","2013-12-02 16:10:28 -0800","That's a big octopus. I had the good fortune to watch this guy emerge from its refuge and slink across the pool. As I was watching its tentacles disappear, I heard a thrashing from the next pool over. I hopped up to check it out and saw the octopus was killing a pretty sizable fish. I thought I was recording video of the whole thing and felt pretty awesome about it, but then realized I had forgotten to hit record. Le sigh.
