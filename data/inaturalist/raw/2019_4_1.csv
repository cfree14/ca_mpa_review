Interesting because it takes a slightly different form than most L. Chamissonis in the area. These are among a patch along Hwy. 1 bordered by residential neighborhoods and strawberry fields. The flowers are darker and smell a bit different than the L. Chamissonis further along Highway 1 north bound, or at Oso Flaco Lake.

Tucked in some tall grass by the side of our playhouse.  In the photos you can see it’s really tiny wing cases. In one of the photos it’s wings seem to be unfolding. It used its middle legs to comb the wings, I think to get them to open. it was also arching all its legs and body backwards and holding that posture, kind of like bug yoga. I don’t know why, maybe also helpful in opening the wings. Seems to have really good eyesight. When I get close with my fingers it leaps into a defensive display, arcing abdomen upwards and opening its jaws.
