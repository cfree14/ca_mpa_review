In the lead shot, the bird on the left is still in basic plumage, while the one on the right has mostly molted into alternate plumage.  Note the enlarged tuft of feathers on its crown, as well as the shock of gold feathers emanating from his red eye.

In the second and last shot of the set, I've zoomed in on the bird that is molting. Once again, note the enlarged tuft of feathers on its crown and the shock of golden feathers sweeping back from its red eye.  Eventually, that shock of golden feathers will fan out around the eye in a striking pattern, the face and chin will turn black, and the flanks will turn a warm, chestnut color (a few early smudges of which have already begun to appear).  The molt will likely have finished in a few weeks, when this bird makes its way back to its traditional summer breeding grounds, somewhere deep in the interior West of the United States and Canada.","Salt Pond A12, Santa Clara County, CA",37.4312107617,-121.9811247289,"Alviso, Alviso Marina County Park, Eared Grebe, Podiceps nigricollis, Rank 2, Salt Pond A12, San Jose, Santa Clara County","Eared Grebe","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/10652330","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/14865205/medium.jpg","arnel",10652330,"Grèbe à cou noir","Aves",4205,2,0,"2018/03/31 9:36 AM PDT","2018-03-31","2018-03-31 16:36:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",5,5,"","open","false","","",29323,"2018-04-06 04:58:04 UTC","2019-02-02 11:24:03 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

Identiified as such from the bird's very heavy, dark streaking and its location in one of the South Bay's salt marshes.

Alviso Marina County Park is located in the Alviso district of San Jose, CA, in northern Santa Clara County.  It is an excellent place to look for Alameda Salt Marsh Song Sparrow, as well as other salt marsh specialists.
