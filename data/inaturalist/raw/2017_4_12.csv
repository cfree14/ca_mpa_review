"Paulownia tomentosa","2017-04-12 00:00:00 -0800","En las instalaciones del Parque Morelos en el Municipio de Tijuana, se observo la presencia de arboles de kiri. Asimismo, en meses anteriores se observo en el vivero del Parque, que estaban produciendo planta de kiri, con fines de reforestación social.

Es importante que el kiri se incluya en el listado de especies exoticas invasoras de la CONABIO, asi como en el listado del Acuerdo de SEMARNAT. 

varios organismos técnicos y especializados nacionales e internacionales consideran al árbol del kiri (Paulownia tomentosa) como una especie exótica invasora que afecta principalmente a la economía y al medio ambiente, ya que es hospedero de Halyomorpha, un insecto que afecta las plantaciones de árboles frutales, ornamentales, maderables y cultivos. El Kiri amenza también a la biodiversidad al desplazar especies de plantas nativas en áreas naturales, empobreciendo con ello los servicios ambientales de los ecosistemas. Un ejemplo de lo anterior, fue el caso del Área Natural de las Montañas Humeantes en Estados Unidos, que desplazo a dos especies de plantas en peligro de extinción. 

Por otro lado, no existen artículos de investigación o estudios científicos serios y arbitrados sobre el metabolismo y fisiología de la planta que aseguren el supuesto beneficio de que absorbe más CO2 que otros árboles.

Algunos de los organismos técnicos y especializados no recomiendan y rechazan la introducción del kiri, por sus diversos impactos, son: la Unión Internacional para la Conservación de la Naturaleza, CABI, Pacific Island Ecosystem at Risk, los Consejos Estatales de Plagas de Plantas Exóticas de los Estados de Georgia, Kentucky, Alabama, Carolina del Sur y Tennessee, la Asociación de Biólogos de Mexicali, entre otros.

Es importante tener en cuenta el riesgo de que una especie exótica se convierta en invasora no debe subestimarse por las implicaciones negativas, directas e indirectas, a largo plazo para la economía, los ecosistemas y la salud, en especial si ya existen los antecedentes de los impactos que ha ocasionado esta especie en particular en otras latitudes
