""Leaf colors basically come from four pigments that are naturally produced by leaf cells .... chlorophyll (green), carotenoid & xanthophyll (yellow,orange, and brown), and anthocyanin (red).   Environmental factors influence the amounts of each pigment in the leaf and can therefore alter leaf color.

Chorophyll, which is usually present in large quantities and reflects green light, can diminish during periods of less sunlight, lower temperatures, higher sugar levels in the plant, and changes in water availability.  When this occurs, the chorophyll no longer can ""mask"" the lesser amounts of the other pigments.  One of these... anthocyanin, is a water-soluble pigment that occurs in cell sap, the molecules reflecting the red wavelengths of light (thus showing red color tot he human eye).""  http://ucanr.edu/blogs/blogcore/postdetail.cfm?postnum=7479","Napa County, CA, USA",38.5774579195,-122.4166773102,"","California black oak","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/13480302","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/19794108/medium.jpg","elainede",13480302,"California black oak","Plantae",49919,1,0,"2018/04/17 12:45 AM HST","2018-04-17","2018-04-17 10:45:00 UTC","Hawaii",1540,1540,"","","false","","",762008,"2018-06-16 15:07:44 UTC","2018-07-23 19:58:17 UTC","research","",NA,NA,"false"

Last year we only had the one, and it was friendly too. Once I went onto my deck and went about my business and it didn't fly away. Later in the year it brought a friend or a young one. 

They seem to go away twice a year then reappear around here for a time. It is April and he just started back around. I can hear the bird's call in the trees early morning and evening. He will finally make his way over to the balcony to enjoy a few seeds.

First the egret approaches the lizard while pointing its bill upward and waving its neck side-to-side.  Then it strikes, catches the lizard in its bill, and waits a bit.  Then it flips its head upward and moves the lizard back in its bill, until it's down the hatch!  As soon as it swallowed this lizard, it proceeded to successfully catch another.  The egret has been here for about ten days and others have also observed it hunting lizards.  At first I was concerned that the bird was ill, but now I think it's doing quite well.","Pinnacles National Park, San Benito, California, United States",36.4957316667,-121.14363,"","American Great Egret","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/11407565","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/16264135/medium.jpg","euproserpinus",11407565,"American Great Egret","Aves",236942,1,0,"2018/04/17 4:48 PM PDT","2018-04-17","2018-04-17 23:48:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","open","false",NA,NA,21370,"2018-04-25 00:31:10 UTC","2018-04-25 02:41:35 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

This flowering plant can grow really tall and large. Some of the leaves are large and some are small . This plants come with different sizes of leaves because the whole plant itself is very large. the flower has anther and everything that can be descripted as angiosperm. Plant have many different part that perform various functions. The two main parts of the plant are the root and shoot. Roots usually grows under the ground, while shoot usually grows above the ground. The shoot has different parts called the stem, leaves, flower and fruit. The stem is the stalk of the plant and it helps the plant to stand upright. It carries water and minerals from the roots to the leaves and carries foods prepared by the leaves to the different part of the plant. Branches are parts that grow from the stem. Leaves grow on the stem and branches. They are usually green due to the presence of chlorophyll, which help them to prepare foods. Leaves have small openings called stomata, through which plants take in and give out air. Flower are the reproductive parts of the plant. They come in different shapes, sizes and colors. By the process of pollination, many flowers develop into fruits. Roots help to anchor the plant to the ground. They absorb the water and minerals required for the growth of the plant.
