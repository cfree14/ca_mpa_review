"Berberis oiwakensis","2018-05-30 13:04:00 -0700","(Genus Mahonia)
A member of Barberries and Allies Family Berberidaceae  Is this AKA Leatherleaf mahonia (Mahonia bealei) AKA Beale's barberry or Oregon Grapeholly?
Fruit hang down, blue color, after bright yellow small flowers had bloomed on stout evergreen shrub 6 feet tall. The yellow flowers had arched upright on 7” long clustered racernes/spikes, on green spiny-toothed spear-shaped pinnate leaves. (I had first observed flowers on 12.28.17 and posted 1.5.18.)
Growing in shopping center, outside small garden on Reseda Blvd. at Superior St. in Northridge, CA.) 
PS
Added the Mahonia oiwakensis Berberidaceae yellow flowers from 5 months earlier, 12.28.17 and a closeup from 1.3.18, and a separate set of leaves.  First time I'd ever seen this flower.
