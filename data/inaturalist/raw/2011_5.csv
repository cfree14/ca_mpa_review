"Opuntia rugosa","2011-05-01 15:48:00 -0600","In 2011, this was still wild habitat.  Now in 2022, there are no cacti in this exact location anymore, but they probably still exist nearby.

The flower photo (same plant) was taken on May 16, and added here to show it along with the other photos.

The fruits showing are old and abnormal, probably with no seeds inside, but still give some idea of how good fruits would look.

This is a distinctive, rare, and likely critically endangered species.  However, it has existed ""off the radar"" since its original description in 1914 by David Griffiths.

Visually (especially in photographs), on one hand, <i>O. rugosa</i> appears similar to true <i>O. littoralis</i> (from nearer the coast).  However, <i>O. rugosa</i> is a relatively small, low spreading plant, while <i>O. littoralis</i> is a much larger, more upright shrubby plant.  On the other hand, it shows strong similarities to the <i>O. phaeacantha</i> group of species.

<i>O. rugosa</i> has survived  near-zero F temperatures under cultivation in New Mexico, while in my experience, <i>O. littoralis</i> is not particularly freeze tolerant and is generally damaged if frozen, and killed at around 15 to 20F.

Other species of <i>Opuntia</i> found growing in the Pamona / San Dimas / Covina area include <i>O. oricola, occidentalis, semispinosa, covillei, vaseyi, basilaris</i>, and an unnamed species (related to <i>O. phaeacantha</i> that is often misidentified as <i>O. covillei</i>).  All of them seem to still be more abundant and wide-spread than is <i>O. rugosa</i>.

"Pacifia goddardi","2011-05-20 00:00:00 -0800","I found five specimens under small rock ledges at Tarpits Reef (see 2nd image) on this date. Most were stranded on a turf composed mainly of erect bryozoans and hydrozoans (see 3rd image). These specimens differed from the type specimen (on which Terry Gosliner based his 2010 description of this species) in having anywhere from traces of to relatively complete white lines on the body (see especially the last image), similar to those on Flabellina trilineata.

Stranded out of the water, F. goddardi appear as red and white blobs up to about 5 mm long. Submerged and crawling, with their long delicate tails fully extended, adults measure 10 to 33 mm long.","Tar Pits Reef, Carpinteria, Santa Barbara County, CA",34.387281,-119.5166,"nudibranch, aeolid, rocky intertidal, California, Flabellina","Goddard's Aeolid","http://inaturalist.ca/observations/2979083","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/3424259/medium.JPG","jeffgoddard",2979083,"Goddard's Aeolid","Mollusca",699208,2,0,"2011-05-20","2011-05-20","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",27,27,"","","false",NA,NA,216076,"2016-04-20 02:43:58 UTC","2021-04-03 01:52:46 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

"Ardea alba","2011-05-23 00:00:00 -0800","I ""discovered"" this Great Blue Heron and Great Egret rookery on May 23, 2011 (I'm sure the neighbors were already aware of it; it's hard not to notice the bizarre noises at a heron-egret rookery). Great Blue Herons used to nest a little ways up the hill, near Villa Chanticleer. According to Audubon Canyon Ranch's Heron and Egret Atlas, that rookery was last known to be occupied in 2002. It looks like the herons have since moved down near the Russian River, and now the rookery includes Great Egrets. It appears two trees are being used, although it's difficult to see the rookery from publicly accessible locations (I imagine it's quite visible from the river itself, if you're boating down). From what I can tell, the Great Blue Herons primarily nest in a redwood, while the egrets nest in a nearby Douglas-fir (this tree is especially hard to see).

In 2011, I was able to see one Great Egret nest from N. Fitch Mountain Rd (everything else was obscured by the branches of neighboring trees).  It was in a Douglas-fir.  In 2012, I could see egrets in a Douglas-fir on several occasions from a great distance (from Healdsburg Ridge Open Space Preserve); presumably, it was the same Douglas-fir that was used in 2011.  I couldn't actually see any nests because of the distance.  On May 1, 2012, when I was near the rookery, I could definitely hear heron and/or egret calls coming from two different trees.

I could see at least 3 Great Blue Heron nests in the redwood on May 24, 2011.  One had a relatively old nestling (as seen in the pictures that I've posted) and the other two seemed to be occupied by adults.  There were 2-3 large herons in the nest tree on June 18, 2011, but I didn't have my spotting scope with me so I couldn't tell if they were nestlings or adults.  The rookery was also used in 2012.  On May 1, I was able to see one Great Blue Heron nest in a redwood (presumably the same tree used in 2011; I was at a different vantage point and could barely see anything) with an adult and two small young.  There were at least two other Great Blue Heron adults in the tree.  It looked like there also might have been a Great Blue Heron in a nest in a Douglas-fir (presumably the same tree that the egrets like).  I checked on the redwood today (June 20) and I could see no activity in the tree - a good number of used nests, though, and lots of whitewash covering the tree.

All of the pictures were taken on May 24, 2011, from a beach access trail at the end of Redwood Dr (there's no nearby parking; you have to walk in from N. Fitch Mtn Rd).

They got very agitated when a scrub-jay flew in and chased it out of the area.

"Pandion haliaetus","2011-05-27 00:00:00 -0800","On multiple occasions in 2011 and 2012, I've observed an Osprey sitting in a stick nest that's built on a nesting platform.  The platform is located at the end of Foreman Ln (south of Healdsburg) and stands on the edge of a vineyard, close to the Russian River.  In 2011, I saw an Osprey on the nest on April 19, May 27 (two Ospreys), and June 23.  So far in 2012, I saw one on the nest on 5/10 and two on 6/1.  I have yet to see any young in this nest.

The pictures of the Osprey with the fish were taken on 5/27/11.  Earlier that day, I'd seen two adults in the nest (shown in the last picture).  Later, an Osprey flew to a telephone pole within a few hundred meters of the nest.  It was picking at the fish while a second Osprey was calling repeatedly from the nest.  I'm assuming this Osprey was the male associated with the nest on the platform.  However, there were two other nests a little further to the south, so it could have belonged to one of those.

The poor fish was still alive, wiggling and trying to escape, as the Osprey picked out pieces of flesh with its super-sharp beak. What a horrible death!

They are pale lavender, and would do no disgrace in any flower bed when they are in their glory.  later they are decidedly peaked, as they fade toward the ground for their winter's rest.  But for the naturalist, they are invariably covered with these great yellow aphids, and their companion shield bugs. Lest you worry, I've never seen these aphids on any of my other plants.

One issue:  I've heard it said that this stuff--the preferred local milkweed-- is A. fascicularis:  'narrow-leafed milkweed'. However, it doesn't look quite narrow enough.

"Calypte anna","2011-05-13 00:00:00 -0800","Female Anna's Hummingbird on nest.  First observed on 4/28, when the nest was still in progress. The female kept leaving and returning to the nest, sitting in it as she stitched things into the rim with her bill; kind of like a sewing machine.  Most of the time, I couldn’t see what she was carrying (if anything) – I figured she must be working with spider webs.  On two occasions, I was able to catch her working something fluffy and/or light green into the inner part of the nest; but both times, I saw it just before she placed in into the nest out of sight.  By 5/13, the exterior of the nest was more fully camouflaged, and the female was simply sitting on the nest.

The nest is actually sitting on the hooked end of a stick that fell out of an overhanging walnut tree and ended up suspended in a smaller understory tree/shrub. It seems rather precarious, but so far, so good.","Badger Park, Healdsburg, CA",38.6083555143,-122.8571422398,"Sonoma County","Anna's Hummingbird","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/17468","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/32425/medium.jpg","emilyheaton",17468,"Anna's Hummingbird","Aves",6317,2,0,"2011-05-13","2011-05-13","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,NA,"open","false",NA,NA,1203,"2011-05-17 21:33:09 UTC","2017-09-29 07:39:52 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
"Buteo lineatus","2011-05-16 00:00:00 -0800","I've been keeping my eye on this nest since early April.  I'd heard a Red-shouldered Hawk calling from it several times but could never see the hawk.  I've had similar experiences at other Red-shouldered Hawk nests this spring - seems they really hunker down while they're incubating eggs.  Yesterday (5/16/11), I finally got a good look.  One hawk flew out and another flew in within 30 seconds, carrying what appeared to be a partially skinned bird.  I wasn't able to see exactly what was happening, but I could tell the adult was tearing off strips of meat and feeding them to at least one small, downy nestling.  Very cool!  It started to rain pretty hard and the adult climbed down into the nest; looked like it was doing its best to provide some shelter from the rain.

The nest is visible from the base of the two large valley oaks at the entrance to the preserve.  It's near the top of the large live oak that's just beyond the black metal gate on the paved road.

Update:  On 5/20/11, I watched an adult feeding two downy nestlings at the nest.  Later, while the adult was still in the nest, I witnessed some behavior that I couldn't figure out.  A second Red-shouldered Hawk flew to the nest with what appeared to be a stick (it definitely didn't seem to be anything to eat) and dropped it in the nest; it perched in the nest tree for awhile and then flew off.  A little later, the hawk in the nest became agitated when a Red-shouldered Hawk flew low over the nest.  Even later, a Red-shouldered Hawk flew away from the nest area carrying a stick; and a short while later, there was an apparent chase between two adults in the nearby woodland (I believe the original adult was still in the nest).  Perhaps the one that was carrying the stick away from the nest was an intruder?

Although I visited Healdsburg Ridge several times after that, I don't have any record of what was going on at the Red-shouldered Hawk nest.  I'm not sure why - bad record keeping!  Perhaps there was nothing going on, but I wish I had bothered to make a note of it.

Pictures: the first two pictures were taken on 5/16/11.  The third picture (blue sky) was taken on 5/20/11 and shows the adult with a downy nestling.","Healdsburg Ridge Open Space Preserve, Healdsburg, CA",38.6395051531,-122.8608061373,"Sonoma County, Healdsburg","Red-shouldered Hawk","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/17467","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/32422/medium.jpg","emilyheaton",17467,"Red-shouldered Hawk","Aves",5206,4,0,"2011-05-16","2011-05-16","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,NA,"open","false",NA,NA,1203,"2011-05-17 20:58:53 UTC","2016-06-22 18:51:01 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

   Indeed we do, now, we didn’t use to however. The Collared Dove has become much more common in the last two years, before that they were essentially only in the Half Moon Bay are and even there they have been around for perhaps 4-5 years. This is a new thing, but I am sure you saw one, they seem to be more and more widely reported now.
