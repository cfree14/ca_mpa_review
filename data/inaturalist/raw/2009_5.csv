Sort of like laughing and throwing up at the same time (except not really).

I'm puzzling over the species here.  I know it's not <i>Pycnogonum</i>, the only other genus I've ever seen, because it has palps.  Given <a href=""http://research.calacademy.org/research/izg/SFBay2K/Pycnogonids_of_SFBay.htm"">this list</a> and the pics and descriptions in Light's, I think <i>Ammothea hilgendorfi</i> seems like a possibility, but my pics aren't really good enough to count segments.  There definitely aren't chelae (though there might be chelifores), and it did have ovigers.
