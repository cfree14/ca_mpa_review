Occasionally another 1-3 random passerby coots would come charging in and hit indiscriminately at either of the pair for a while before departing.  Strange!  

Videos: 
1.) https://youtu.be/Tbt5NdC_w78 (many coots pile on)
2.) https://youtu.be/MEFFgCtecE8 (extended three-way slap fight)
3.) https://youtu.be/agt1JDt1Shk (end of the fight. this makes it look like one of the coots died, but actually it swan away underwater and re-emerged far away)

Asci biseriate, with small apical ring?
No amyloid reactions visible anywhere, but I didn't do any KOH pretreatment, as is apparently necessary for Pezoloma...

I always thought KOH and Melzer's don't mix. But maybe what's asked for is KOH and then Lugol's, and perhaps those play better together?
