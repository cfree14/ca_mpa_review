But yes, cotyledons petioled, and I assume not leaving a circular scar when and if they wither and fall off. As opposed to an annual with sessile cotyledon. 

I couldn't check the keel margins for hairs, but last year I did on the population here

Also the leaves look blunt and thin often for this species. I keyed out an individual in this vicinity, and nothing looks quite like it around here.

Flowers are spiraled on the inflorescence axis, which is another trait of this species.

Also the petiole is 3--10 cm, flat, and leaflet-like in this species.

"Lupinus truncatus","2019-03-11 16:35:00 -0700","Cotyledons petioled, you can see  them well in the photo where I have the pen sticking in the ground. Pen is for scale, it is a retractable bic. But yes, cotyledons petioled, and I assume not leaving a circular scar when and if they wither and fall off. As opposed to an annual with sessile cotyledon.

I couldn't check the keel margins for hairs, but last year I did. Also the leaves look blunt tipped usually, in this species.

I keyed out an individual in this vicinity, and nothing looks quite like it around here. Also, the species has a certain look you get to know, like any plant.

Flowers are spiraled on the inflorescence axis, which is another trail of this species.

Look closely and zoom in to see small flower buds!

There are many more in the area, some with slightly larger buds, I will post.","California, US",35.1037942324,-120.5001128317,"","collared annual lupine","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/21171020","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/32724423/medium.jpg","leafybye",21171020,"Lupinus truncatus","Plantae",58906,0,0,"2019/03/11 4:35 PM PDT","2019-03-11","2019-03-11 23:35:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,28734,"obscured","","true","","",677840,"2019-03-12 06:58:45 UTC","2019-03-22 05:19:12 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

The cap felt dry, not slippery or sticky. There did not appear to be any veil remnants, just a lot of dirt, bark and other stuff.
