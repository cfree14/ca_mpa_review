"Festuca","2012-08-10 11:12:57 -0600","Technically this might be Festuca brachyphylla because of the high elevation habitat, tightly bunched growth habit, and small anthers (ca. 1 mm).

The 2nd photo of the purplish and somewhat hairy flowering stems suggests this might be Festuca baffinensis, but this is supposedly known from the Rocky Mountains and not from the Sierra Nevada. Perhaps it could be Festuca brachyphylla because of the high elevation habitat, tightly bunched growth habit, and small anthers (ca. 1 mm). However, the the old leaves associated with the leaf bunch are characteristic of Festuca idahoensis, a species that is more widespread and more ecologically and morphologically variable than seemingly appreciated.

White sagebrush is a native rhizomatous forb that ranges in stature 15-90 cm tall.

"Dedeckera eurekensis","2012-08-27 13:03:34 -0700","July gold, Dedeckera eurekensis, White Mountains, elevation 1575 m (5165 ft).

The only species in this rare shrub genus, July gold is related to Eriogonum in the Polygonaceae.  It is found in only a few canyons with a strong carbonate bedrock component, in the mountains of Inyo and southern Mono counties, California. The species was first discovered in Eureka Valley, and presents huge masses of tiny golden-yellow flowers during the peak of summer heat when little else blooms, thus its common name.  The plant in this photo is in fruit and late flower (open near center of image) at the end of August.

The genus is named after <a href=""http://bristleconecnps.org/dedecker/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">Mary DeDecker</a>, good friend and pioneering botanist and conservationist in the &quot;Land of Little Rain.&quot;

Xferrisii is the only scouring rush present.  No E. hyemale has been found in the range.

One of the farthest north (and highest elevation) creosote bushes I have encountered.  I know of 3 other isolated plants along the south edge of the White Mountains that are at slightly higher latitude.  In my opinion, these are more likely the result of recent successful dispersals, rather than remnants from past warm cycles.  The nearest continuous Larrea vegetation is less than 10 air miles to the southeast (and about 1000-2000 feet lower) in Eureka Valley.  Have encountered individual plants as high as 6000 feet elevation between the two locations.  Poised for climate change...?

Only this single very healthy plant was found despite multiple further searches of the area.

Trip sponsored and led by Alvaro Jaramillo.  This bird appears to have five fresh inner primaries, three abraded outer primaries and is perhaps molting in P5 and/or P6 here?  The fact that it is only partly through molting at this date suggests it is a first cycle individual - photo analyzed briefly by Steve Howell at a molt workshop in September 2012 - he felt the date the photo was taken was critical in aging the bird.

"Equisetum laevigatum","2012-08-25 10:38:20 -0700","WWCA Site 6 on S Fk Wolf Creek. Equisetum laevigatum or E. hyemale? Commonly known as horsetail fern.

I notice that the joints are telescopic. Black or black, gray, black joints and fluorescent green above the joints, more double banded at the bottom and single at the top, with a button where the fruit or flower was at the top. Some joints have smaller, jointed branches growing to the side. They grow close together about 5 or 6 feet high, just above the stream banks, extending on the flat for about 3 meters.

I wonder
 What the root system is like?
What uses there are for it?
Are they typically found by streams?

My guess is that they have a common root system for many plants.

The snake was enjoying the happy hunts within my flower garden.Unfortunately the Racer was very fast, ultimately eluding me before I could retrieve a camera.  The snake was adept at scaling about 18 inches of my fence to find an escape rout to the other side which borders open sage.  Several riparian habitats are within walking distance of my back fence.  I am certain of this identification as the Racer stands in significant contrast to the usual suspects of my area.","spanish springs, nv",39.6052321688,-119.6999523651,"","Western Yellow-bellied Racer","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/114391","","swnicholas",114391,"Western Yellow-bellied Racer","Reptilia",200661,0,0,"2012-08-18","2012-08-18","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","open","false","","",8876,"2012-08-19 18:46:49 UTC","2014-10-19 19:16:51 UTC","casual","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

"Polyergus mexicanus","2012-08-01 00:00:00 -0800","Ugh! This camera is SO not up to the task, but this is an amazing photo, nevertheless.

Lower right: A red slave-maker (Polyergus breviceps) is carrying a stolen pupa back into its cryptic home nest where it will hatch into a black ant (Formica sp., probably microphthalma), chemically imprint, and go cheerfully to work taking care of its red masters. Notice the carefully adapted red mandibles that grasp the pupa neatly and gently around the narrowing.

Meanwhile, upper left, an exhausted red raider is carried home by a black slave.

Ants are scary--no, make that horrifying--in their implications.

Other photos: booty hand-off. Little girl defends!: chewing my cuticle and humping up to spray formic acid in the wound.

Note: The range of what is currently considered P. breviceps doesn't extend westward beyond the Rocky Mountains. <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/33260541/Trager_2013_Polyergus_revision.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1513063101&Signature=cr8gtUYsrjnKmI4LDMhMJDNUNh8%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DGlobal_revision_of_the_dulotic_ant_genus.pdf"">Source</a>.

More from James C. Trager:

""...both genetic and morphological evidence lend support to the separation of P. umbratus from P. mexicanus.
 
By the way, at Sagehen, Polyergus uses at least three (maybe four) different species of Formica as hosts, though apparently only one in any given colony. They are F. argentea, , F. microphthalma, and F. fusca, (and maybe F. accreta). 

In th[is] picture..., based on relatively sparse pilosity, and short and not very silvery appressed pubescence, and apparently rather small eye size, the host species is most likely F. microphthalma.""","Sagehen Creek Field Station",39.4268994835,-120.3133974199,"insects, ants","Western Amazon Ant","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/108895","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/155737/medium.jpg","faerthen",108895,"Western Amazon Ant","Insecta",472214,3,0,"2012-08-01","2012-08-01","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,NA,"","false","","",4918,"2012-08-03 05:31:58 UTC","2021-12-05 21:32:17 UTC","research","CC-BY",NA,NA,"false"
