"Lecanora","2018-05-08 18:30:00 -0700","I've been fascinated for years by these gray to very pale pastel-green crustose lichens which often form patches and lateral bands on the trunks of Coast Live Oaks (<i>Quercus agrifolia</i>) in frequently  foggy parts of the CA Coast Ranges.  (If you click the photo twice, the full-size image shows fairly good detail.)   Sometimes the greenish-gray bands alternate with subtly mauve bands, and there are scattered black lichen ""spots"" [I don't know if the black spots  are some sort of fruiting bodies or what...but they look very ""disconnected"" from one another, as if they're either erupting from beneath the  gray-green and purplish thalli or produced by (or parasitic on?) them].

I initially noticed this ""lichen pattern"" on Coast Live Oaks,  and presumed it constituted a coherent & consistent cluster of lichen species associated specifically with the bark of <i>Quercus agrifolia</i>.   But I now think that was likely a neophyte's naive misconception...lichen are much more taxonomically diverse than I realized, and the nuances distinguishing taxa are quite  subtle.  I've since seen a similar ""lichen pattern"" on the bark of Toyon (<i>Heteromeles arbutifolia</i>), and  it may be present on other trees & shrubs.  And there may be many other ""lichen patterns"" on Coast Live Oak that involve all sorts of combinations of species.

"Plantago major","2018-05-08 17:24:05 -0700","Herb: Common Plantain
Latin name: Plantago major
Family: Plantaginaceae (Plantain Family)

Medicinal use of Common Plantain: Common plantain is a safe and effective treatment for bleeding, it quickly staunches blood flow and encourages the repair of damaged tissue. The leaves are astringent, demulcent, deobstruent, depurative, diuretic, expectorant, haemostatic and refrigerant. Internally, they are used in the treatment of a wide range of complaints including diarrhoea, gastritis, peptic ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, haemorrhage, haemorrhoids, cystitis, bronchitis, catarrh, sinusitis, asthma and hay fever. They are used externally in treating skin inflammations, malignant ulcers, cuts, stings etc. The heated leaves are used as a wet dressing for wounds, swellings etc. The root is a remedy for the bite of rattlesnakes, it is used in equal portions with Marrubium vulgare. The seeds are used in the treatment of parasitic worms. Plantain seeds contain up to 30% mucilage which swells up in the gut, acting as a bulk laxative and soothing irritated membranes. Sometimes the seed husks are used without the seeds. A distilled water made from the plant makes an excellent eye lotion.

Description of the plant:

Plant:
Perennial


Height:
12 cm
(4 3/4 inch)
Flovering:
May to
September
Habitat of the herb: A common garden weed, particularly in lawns. Rarely in grassy places.

Edible parts of Common Plantain: Young leaves - raw or cooked. They are rather bitter and tedious to prepare because the fibrous strands need to be removed before use. It is best not to use the leaf-stalk since this is even more fibrous than the leaf. Many people blanch the leaves in boiling water before using them in salads in order to make them more tender. A Chinese form has more palatable leaves - it contains about 2.7% protein, 0.4% fat, 2.2% ash. Seed - raw or cooked. Very tedious to harvest. The seed can be ground into a meal and mixed with flour. It is very rich in vitamin B1. The whole seeds can be boiled and used like sago. The dried leaves make an acceptable tea. Root. No further details.

Propagation of the herb: Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in early summer. A sowing can be made outdoors in situ in mid to late spring if you have enough seeds.

Cultivation of Common Plantain: A common garden weed, particularly in lawns. Rarely in grassy places.

"Taraxacum officinale","2018-05-08 17:20:55 -0700","Herb: Dandelion
Latin name: Taraxacum officinale
Synonyms: Taraxacum vulgare
Family: Compositae

Medicinal use of Dandelion: The dandelion is a commonly used herbal remedy. It is especially effective and valuable as a diuretic because it contains high levels of potassium salts and therefore can replace the potassium that is lost from the body when diuretics are used. All parts of the plant, but especially the root, are slightly aperient, cholagogue, depurative, strongly diuretic, hepatic, laxative, stomachic and tonic. The root is also experimentally cholagogue, hypoglycaemic and a weak antibiotic against yeast infections. The dried root has a weaker action. The roots can be used fresh or dried and should be harvested in the autumn when 2 years old. The leaves are harvested in the spring when the plant is in flower and can be dried for later use. A tea can be made from the leaves or, more commonly, from the roots. The plant is used internally in the treatment of gall bladder and urinary disorders, gallstones, jaundice, cirrhosis, dyspepsia with constipation, oedema associated with high blood pressure and heart weakness, chronic joint and skin complaints, gout, eczema and acne. The plant has an antibacterial action, inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Pneumococci, Meningococci, Bacillus dysenteriae, B. typhi, C. diphtheriae, Proteus etc. The latex contained in the plant sap can be used to remove corns, warts and verrucae. The latex has a specific action on inflammations of the gall bladder and is also believed to remove stones in the liver. A tea made from the leaves is laxative.

Description of the plant:

Plant:
Perennial


Height:
45 cm
(1 foot)
Flovering:
April
to May

Scent:
Scented
Perennial
Habitat of the herb: A very common weed of grassland and cultivated ground.

Edible parts of Dandelion: Leaves - raw or cooked. When used in salads, they are rather bitter, though less so in the winter. Tender young leaves are considerably less bitter than older leaves. The leaves are often blanched (by excluding light from the growing plant) before use. This will make them less bitter, but they will also contain less vitamins and minerals. A very nutritious food, 100g of the raw leaves contain about 2.7g. protein, 9.2g. carbohydrate, 187mg Calcium, 66mg phosphorus, 3.1mg iron, 76mg sodium, 397mg potassium, 36mg magnesium, 14000iu vitamin A, 0.19mg vitamin B1, 0.26mg vitamin B2, 35mg vitamin C. Root - raw or cooked. Bitter. A turnip-like flavour. Flowers - raw or cooked. A rather bitter flavour, the unopened flower buds can be used in fritters and they can also be preserved in vinegar and used like capers. Both the leaves and the roots are used to flavour herbal beers and soft drinks such as ""Dandelion and Burdock"". The roots of 2 year old plants are harvested in the autumn, dried and roasted to make a very good coffee substitute. It is caffeine-free. A pleasant tea is made from the flowers. They are also used to make wine - all green parts should be removed when making wine to prevent a bitter flavour. The leaves and the roots can also be used to make tea.

Other uses of the herb: The flowers are an ingredient of ""QR"" herbal compost activator. This is a dried and powdered mixture of several herbs that can be added to a compost heap in order to speed up bacterial activity and thus shorten the time needed to make the compost. A liquid plant feed can be made from the root and leaves. A low quality latex, which can be used for making rubber, can be obtained from the roots of this plant. A magenta-brown dye is obtained from the root. The plant releases ethylene gas, this stunts the growth of nearby plants and causes premature ripening of fruits. A distilled water made from the ligules (thin appendages at the base of the leaf blades) is used cosmetically to clear the skin and is particularly effective in fading freckles.

Propagation of Dandelion: Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and either surface-sow or only just cover the seed. Make sure the compost does not dry out. Germination should take place within 2 weeks, though 2 weeks cold stratification may improve germination. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, choosing relatively deep pots to accommodate the tap root. Plant them out in early summer. Division in early spring as the plant comes into growth.

Cultivation of the herb: A very common weed of grassland and cultivated ground.

Known hazards of Taraxacum officinale: This plant has been mentioned in various books on poisonous plants but any possible toxins will be of very low concentration and toxicity. There are reports that some people have suffered dermatitis as a result of touching the plant, this is probably caused by the latex in the leaves and stems.

"Plantago lanceolata","2018-05-08 17:09:19 -0700","Herb: Ribwort Plantain
Latin name: Plantago lanceolata
Family: Plantaginaceae (Plantain Family)

Medicinal use of Ribwort Plantain: Ribwort plantain is a safe and effective treatment for bleeding, it quickly staunches blood flow and encourages the repair of damaged tissue. The leaves contain mucilage, tannin and silic acid. An extract of them has antibacterial properties. They have a bitter flavour and are astringent, demulcent, mildly expectorant, haemostatic and ophthalmic. Internally, they are used in the treatment of a wide range of complaints including diarrhoea, gastritis, peptic ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, haemorrhage, haemorrhoids, cystitis, bronchitis, catarrh, sinusitis, asthma and hay fever. They are used externally in treating skin inflammations, malignant ulcers, cuts, stings etc. The heated leaves are used as a wet dressing for wounds, swellings etc. The root is a remedy for the bite of rattlesnakes, it is used in equal portions with Marrubium vulgare. The seeds are used in the treatment of parasitic worms. Plantain seeds contain up to 30% mucilage which swells up in the gut, acting as a bulk laxative and soothing irritated membranes. Sometimes the seed husks are used without the seeds. A distilled water made from the plant makes an excellent eye lotion.

"Lotus corniculatus","2018-05-08 17:00:06 -0700","Herb: Bird's Foot Trefoil
Latin name: Lotus corniculatus
Family: Leguminosae

Medicinal use of Bird's Foot Trefoil: Carminative, febrifuge, hypoglycaemic, restorative, vermifuge. The flowers are antispasmodic, cardiotonic and sedative. The root is carminative, febrifuge, restorative and tonic. The plant is used externally as a local anti-inflammatory compress in all cases of skin inflammation.

Description of the plant:

Plant:
Perennial


Height:
30 cm
(11 3/4 inch)
Flovering:
June to
September

Scent:
Scented
Perennial
Habitat of the herb: Pastures and sunny banks of streams, especially on calcareous soils. 

Edible parts of Bird's Foot Trefoil: The young seedpods are ""nibbled"". Caution is advised, see notes above on toxicity.

Other uses of the herb: An orange-yellow dye is obtained from the flowers. A useful green manure plant, fixing atmospheric nitrogen. It is difficult to see this plant as a useful green manure, it is fairly slow growing with us and does not produce much bulk.

Propagation of Bird's Foot Trefoil: Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in the spring or autumn in situ. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 15�C. If seed is in short supply, it can be sown in pots in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in late spring or early summer.

Cultivation of the herb: Pastures and sunny banks of streams, especially on calcareous soils. 

Known hazards of Lotus corniculatus: All parts of the plant are poisonous, containing cyanogenic glycosides(hydrogen cyanide). In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death. This species is polymorphic for cyanogenic glycosides. The flowers of some forms of the plant contain traces of prussic acid and so the plants can become mildly toxic when flowering. They are completely innocuous when dried.
