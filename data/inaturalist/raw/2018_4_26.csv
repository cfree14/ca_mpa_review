I noticed commotion high up in a Eucalyptus tree and realized the bird was carrying a long rope in her beak. There was a lot of wing flapping and I feared she was caught in the rope, but then it became clear she wanted the rope up there, perhaps for her nest? At one point she dropped the rope, but she retrieved it and continued. After over an hour, she succeeded to wind the rope around a tree branch, and when the sun was low she flew away. I'll keep an eye on this today.
