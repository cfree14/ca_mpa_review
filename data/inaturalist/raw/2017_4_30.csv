This tidy member of the sunflower family is found nearly throughout Nevada and the Great Basin desert of the western United States, extending shortly into the adjacent northern Mojave Desert, Colorado Plateau of Utah and northern Arizona, and Snake River plains of southern Idaho.  It seems to have a strong preference for dry barren calcareous soils of various textures from rocky to mostly clay, below about 2100 meters (6900 feet) elevation.  The substrate here is steep scree of decaying carbonate outcrops.

Also identifiable in this image are Nevada Mormon tea (Ephedra nevadensis) and desert trumpet (Eriogonum inflatum).

This locally common and variable species reaches its western limit here, and otherwise shares nearly the same geographic range as Nevada sunray posted just before this - Great Basin desert and immediately adjacent parts of the northern Mojave Desert, Colorado Plateau, and Snake River Plains of the interior western United States.  It has a preference for dry, open, calcareous, often clayey soils at low to mid elevations.  The soil here is gravel scree of decaying carbonate outcrops.

This species is immediately distinguished by its hairy flowers from many similar species with mounded habit and white flowers in round heads.  In other parts of its range to the east, some plants have yellow flowers, and other plants form large mats up to 2 meters (6 feet) across.

This subshrub species is found only in the transition zone from the northern Mojave Desert to the southern Great Basin desert of southern Nevada and adjacent eastern California, on dry rocky slopes and alluvium at elevations below about 2000 meters (6600 feet).  It seems to have a preference for calcareous soils, such as the decomposing carbonate gravel here, but has also been seen on granitic alluvium.

Several other plant species from this region are also named after William Hillman Shockley (1855-1925), who among many talents was a mining engineer and plant collector based out of the mining town of Candelaria, Nevada, in the 1880s, where he collected the type specimen for this species.

Also know as little blazing star, this is one of our most abundant and widespread desert annual species. A few plants can usually be found flowering even in very dry years. Its geographic range also extends well beyond the North American deserts to include most of the interior western U.S. below 2300 meters (7500 feet) elevation, plus adjacent southwestern Canada and northwestern Mexico.

Seeds of this species were harvested by indigenous people, and were considered a dietary staple by some bands of Paiute.

The common name stickleaf comes from the tiny barbed hairs on the foliage and other parts of most Mentzelia species, which cause them to adhere to clothing and other passing epidermal coverings, and no doubt aid in dispersal of the plants and their seeds.

This is an example of a self-armoring desert annual species.  The sticky (and aromatic) exudate of dense glands on the leaves and lower stems captures wind-blown sand grains, which then help to protect the plant from further sand-blasting, and to moderate the effects of intense solar radiation, evaporative loss, and potential herbivores.  Many other desert annuals employ this same strategy, which uniquely adapts them to survival in sandy habitats.

This species is widespread in such habitats of the Mojave Desert, southern Great Basin, and adjacent Colorado Plateau of southeastern California, south and central Nevada, south and west Utah, and northwest and central Arizona.

Variety rosacea is found toward the southern portion of the overall species range, in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts of the southwestern United States and adjacent northern Mexico, and apparently reaches its northern and high-elevation limits near here, in and around the White Mountains.

This is the main Sphaeralcea taxon on the northeast side of the White Mountains.  Flowers vary from white to lavender and pink, instead of the usual orange for variety ambigua, which is found mainly on the south and west sides of the White Mountains.  Flower color seems to be the only difference between the two varieties, but they seem to segregate into separate populations where their ranges overlap.

"Tetradymia axillaris axillaris","2017-04-30 15:51:15 -0700","cottonthorn, Tetradymia axillaris var. axillaris, California, White Mountains, McAfee Creek, Fishlake Valley drainage, elevation 1647 m (5405 ft).

The common name of this desert shrub refers to the dense cottony hairs on the young spines, which later shed their hairs.  Anatomically the spines form from the primary leaves of the plant (true thorns come from branches instead).  The green leaves that you see on the plant are actually secondary leaves that develop after the primaries.

Tetradymia axillaris is nearly endemic to the western and northern Mojave Desert of eastern California, southern Nevada, and southwest Utah below about 2300 meters (7550 feet) elevation.  It extends only shortly into the surrounding mountains and Great Basin desert.  The variety axillaris, characterized by its smooth green phyllaries, is even more restricted, found only in the northern Mojave - southern Great Basin transition zone of southern Nevada and adjacent California.

"Carduus pycnocephalus","2017-04-30 14:51:00 -0700","Italian Thistle (Carduus pycnocephalus) is such a widespread and invasive plant that it doesn't need much of an introduction.  Although it is not as robust as Bull Thistle (Cirsium vulgare) or Milk Thistle (Silybum marianum), it is every bit as welll-armored as those non-native invasives,, with spines covering adorning its leaves, stems, bracts, and phyllaries. It is also quite prolfic with its seeds, allowing it to form dense, almost monocultural stands such as the one depicted in this photo.

Key Field Marks visible in photo:

1) Leaves spiny.
2) Corolla white to red, blue or purple.  (They're magenta in this photo.)
3) Stemp spiny and winged.
4) Flower heads generally 2-5 per cluster, often clustered at branch tips, short-peduncled or sessile.
5) Involucres cilindric or ellipsoid.  (Ellipsoid for these individual plants.)

Key field marks not visible or not obvious in this photo:

1) Pappus of rough or barbed bristles or slender scales (internal structuures to the plant's involucres) 
2) Phyllaries generally <= 2 mm wide.  (Phyllaries here are about 1 mm wide.)
3) Involucres 1 to 3 cms wide.  (Here, they are generally about 1 cm wide.)

"Cicadomorpha","2017-04-30 00:00:00 -0800","I found this Leafhopper/Treehopper clinging to its favorite Cotoneaster leaf along the Stevens Creek Trail in Mountain View, CA.  Leafhoppers and Treehoppers are a vast and diverse family of insects, with over 3000 species of Leafhoppers in North America alone, so just getting to the correct tribe would be difficult, never mind species! That, I think, I will leave to the specialists.

I did try to photograph this insect from different angles and distances to make its identification as straightforward as possible, but as it was a fairly windy afternoon, these three shots were the only ones that did not come out as a collection of blurs.  Two of the shots were accomplished with a bit of flash, and the remaining shot was taken in natural light.  All of them show an insect that was almost an inch long, and tawny brown in color with darker stripes and mottling.  The eye appears to be transparent, with just a tiny dot at the center resembling a pupil at the center.

Photographed near the Yuba Drive trailhead of the Stevens Creek Trail.  I have tentatively identified the Cotoneaster bush that it is on as a Silverleaf Cotoneaster (Cotoneaster pannosus).  This particular bush was the subject of another submittal that I just posted to iNaturalist.","Stevens Creek Trail (near the Yuba Drive trailhead), Mountain View, CA",37.383065,-122.068486,"","Spittlebugs, Cicadas, Leafhoppers and Treehoppers","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/6178642","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/7751901/medium.jpg","arnel",6178642,"Spittlebugs, Cicadas, Leafhoppers, and Treehoppers","Insecta",372849,3,0,"2017-04-30","2017-04-30","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",3,3,"","","false","","",29323,"2017-05-12 05:08:26 UTC","2020-12-01 21:35:31 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC","",NA,"false"

"Cotoneaster pannosus","2017-04-30 00:00:00 -0800","I found this interesting non-native shrub along the Stevens Creek Trail in Mountain View, CA.  I've tentatively identified it as a Silverleaf Cotoneaster (Cotoneaster pannosus), based on:

(1) Its dense corymbs of small, white, five-petaled flowers with many spirally-arranged stamens,
(2) its elliptical leaves with simple margins and tomentose hairs on their lower surfaces (but little to no hair on their upper surfaces); 
(3) the alternate arrangement of the leaves;
(4) the tomentose hairs on the young growth of twigs;
(5) the shrub's resemblance to pyracantha (but lacking the pyracantha's thorns).

I am by no means a cotoneaster expert, however, so I'm open to suggestions as to what this shrub might be.

Shot 1 shows has a good shot of the open flowers, in varying states of maturity. You can also see the tomentose undersurface of the leaves if you look at the young leaves to the upper left of the flowers.  Shot 2 focuses primarily on the leaves, their alernate arrangement, and the tomontose hairs of the undersurface forming a fuzzy fringe to each leaf.","Stevens Creek Trail (near Yuba Drive trailhead), Mountain View, CA",37.383029,-122.068481,"","silverleaf cotoneaster","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/6169950","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/7739048/medium.jpg","arnel",6169950,"Silverleaf cotoneaster","Plantae",53375,0,0,"2017-04-30","2017-04-30","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",3,3,"","","false","","",29323,"2017-05-11 14:50:33 UTC","2017-05-11 14:56:37 UTC","casual","CC-BY-NC","",NA,"true"

#3 on Highway 17 in 2017

I saw a dead raccoon on northbound Highway 17 near the Lark Ave. exit, not far from the one I saw last week, which is still there.

A lot of raccoons are killed by vehicles in this area. I see one or more every weekend. The speed limit is 55, but many cars are traveling much faster than that.

If one is killed per week, that's 52 per year, just in this stretch of highway between the Hwy 9 exit and Lark Ave. I'm glad MROSD has a project in the works to provide a safety corridor for wildlife!","Los Gatos, CA, US",37.244947,-121.962182,"raccoon, roadkill","Common Raccoon","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/6048927","","truthseqr",6048927,"Common Raccoon","Mammalia",41663,0,0,"2017-04-30 12:15 PM","2017-04-30","2017-04-30 19:15:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",17,17,"","","false","","",209572,"2017-05-02 12:25:55 UTC","2018-01-17 03:09:36 UTC","casual","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

Usually, when I see quail here, they are startled by my presence and they fly away into dense shrubbery before I can get a picture.

on moist sandstone bank next to road

small

curious lobes (~ 4mm wide), slightly concave, shiny surface, 

The lobes seem to be attached at one point on the lower surface (but can't visualize the attachment mechanism...).  Some lobe have lobules (small growths on edge). 

There appears to be (coralloid?) isidia on some of the margins
