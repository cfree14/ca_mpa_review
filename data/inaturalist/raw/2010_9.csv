We went out to find a shapeless mass sloshing back and forth in the gentle shorebreak.  It extended about 30': a headless mass with about 4' of caudal vertebrae sticking out into the surf.  My son had thoughtfully brought a heavy serrated knife...

While we struggled like a couple madmen out in the water, cutting slowly through the incredibly tough annulus fibrosis, a young woman came up, lifted a flap of hide; and secured a mighty humerus.  It was entirely clean, just as long as mine; but immensely thicker. Ultimately, we loosed the vertebral segment shown;  my nephew cut of a piece of hide and carried in his backpack until his mother found it a bit later.
That it was a grey whale could be disputed.  Since one was killed 2 weeks before when a freighter transitted the Golden Gate certainly fit; and the children were quite satisfied.  Evidently that was not a unique misadvent, but just part of the cost of doing business.

"Glaucidium gnoma","2010-09-22 00:00:00 -0800","This is one of a pair of Northern Pygmy-owls that I observed preening each other on the walnut tree above the old barn at the Garrison Cabin. Over the course of summer 2010 Pygmy-owls were calling in the early morning hours, sometimes simultaneously with Western Screech owls. It was the first time I had ever heard these diurnal owls calling at 3 AM. I had at first assumed the night time calls were Saw-whets but changed my mind when I finally saw these guys buzz over my head when I was calling at them during the day time.  

Back in the late 1980s and early 1990s I used to climb trees at Pepperwood in spring and call for these owls and almost without fail they  would join me in the treetop, sometimes within two meters. Sightings included on Grouse Hill and along Martin Creek just below the Strebel Homestead.
