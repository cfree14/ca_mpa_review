<p>These were so annoying to get.  They actually grow in ~2 inches of water, with just the orange bulbs at the end above water.  So, to hunt for these, you tromp around in 1-6 inches of water, in early June, at 8,000 feet, where it had snowed the day before&#8230;  I was very cold and miserable, but continued for the 1/2 hour it took to find these, and then I gave up, and was out of there.</p>
<p>They were a pretty little fungus, and I guess worth it to find them, but I was a low point in terms of cold and wet for the week with these&#8230;</p>","Bassetts, Sierra Co., California, USA",39.616,-120.5845,"","swamp beacon","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60649778","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/96994193/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60649778,"swamp beacon","Fungi",320702,2,0,"2005-06-09","2005-06-09","","UTC",5650,5650,"","","false","","",734334,"2020-09-24 21:11:50 UTC","2020-09-26 23:16:34 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC-ND",NA,NA,"false"

<p>These were the most often found mushroom up there for the week.  There are the classic snow bank mushroom, actually fruiting just under the melting snow, and appearing as the edge of the snow bank melts away.  Often the growing mushroom produces some heat, and melts a small circle clear of snow, if the snow is thin enough, and it is warm enough.</p>
<p>This species is also hygophanous, and its color would change quite a bit depending on the moisture content.  Anything from dark grey, to light tan.  One frustrating day I gathered what I thought was 3-4 different species, and they were all this one, oh well.</p>

From Sterling Canyon Campground, follow the creekbed to the West, northerly direction.  Possibly 1/4 or 1/2 mile up the creek.   The creek bed eventually deepens and is in a 'canyon' with walls where you can see layers of earth, about 15 feet deep.  Later the park added gates, maybe to keep out vehicles, but they can be easily passed while hiking.  There are mountains nearby that get snow, so the creek was probably runoff from melting snow farther up the mountain,   Frazier or Alamo?  Oh there is a parking fee to enter Hungry Valley OHV 'park'.
Added more pictures, with the deeper part of the creek.   Tadpoles were found 15 minutes  closer to the campground, than the 'grand canyon', and near the big tree landmark photo for site reference.","Hungry Valley State Vehicular Recreation Area, Ventura County, US-CA, US",34.770701,-118.885889,"","Western Toad","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/793701","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/998595/medium.JPG","cspnl",793701,"Western Toad","Amphibia",64970,1,0,"2005-06-19 7:49 AM","2005-06-19","2005-06-19 14:49:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",594,594,"","","false",NA,"",37802,"2014-07-20 20:15:25 UTC","2017-08-08 01:01:46 UTC","research","",NA,NA,"false"
