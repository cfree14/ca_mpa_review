"","2018-05-01 06:25:00 -1000","SF Bay Stranding Report and Update, May 5th-6th, 2018.

Crown Memorial Beach; Crown beach and Park St. and Shoreline, East Bay Regional Parks (Alameda Ca).

More reports and grim evidence of ongoing epizootic event currently leaving alot of mostly dead fish and some bat rays washing ashore at coves and shorelines in and around Crown Beach Memorial Park and adjacent beach front. Not sure what exactly is happening but its definitely depositing alot of remnants around Crown beach. Site monitors M. Anders and crew are noting and documenting new specimens and discerning between newly deposited specimens and those accumulating.

Something is apparently happening nearby and some of the dead fish and rays are being carried with the currents and depositing there along the shores and catchment embayments and points.

Volunteers are seeking live or fresh dead intact specimens intending to ship them to Dr Mark (Mark Okihiro) for lab work ups.

Overall 2018 has seen fewer strandings, but a steady stream of reports with a current hotspot ongoing in Alameda involving some rays but mostly large numbers of mostly striped bass and follows similar pattern noted last year at the same sites.

If you see a dead, apparently dying, distressed, trapped or entangled/injured shark, ray, skate or fish immediately contact the Pelagic Shark Research Foundation via dispatch 831 600 5214 and/or email/message PSRF's Stranding Rescue and Specimen Collecting Unit via psrf@pelagic.org

"Rhopalomyia","2018-05-01 18:30:00 -0700","There were many of these ""cotton ball"" galls on this little rabbitbrush plant. High sagebrush desert; 4500 ft asl in northern Nevada.

Presumably caused by the
Tepharitid fruit fly (Aciurina bigeloviae).

Here info from blog ""The Nature Niche"" at <https://thenatureniche.com/2013/11/04/rabbitbrush-cotton-gall/>

""A tepharitid fruit fly (Aciurina bigeloviae) induces a fascinating gall on rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa). In the spring the adult cotton gall fruit fly emerges, mates and deposits an egg in an auxillary rabbitbrush bud. Via mechanisms that are not yet completely understood, when the egg is ovipsited chemical stimulants are also injected into the bud, which cause abnormal growth and development of the plant bud. Usually found on areas of newer growth, the rabbitbrush cotton gall is a compact cluster of white hairs surrounding a monothalamous (single) chamber where the larva develops once the egg hatches. The larva overwinters in the gall. White, round and resembling a cotton ball attached to the stem,  rabbitbrush cotton galls occur singly or as pairs. Old galls persist on the rabbitbrush for years after the adult has emerged through a hole. Rabbitbrush cotton galls are slow growing with fresh galls being found into the late fall.

Rabbitbrush grows in areas with cold temperatures and deep snow in the winter. A. bigeloviae may produce cryptoprotectants, chemicals that help maintain internal gall temperatures and protect the resident larvae from external freezing conditions.

With plant galls, the relationship between insect (or fungi or bacteria) and plant species is specific.
