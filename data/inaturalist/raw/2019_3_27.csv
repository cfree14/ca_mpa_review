"Cryptantha muricata jonesii","2019-03-27 18:17:00 -0700","Hellhole Canyon.
This is var. jonesii, that for some reason has been omitted in iNat and the Kew List.
Measurements:
- plant with a single main stem, branched only in upper half.
- calyx in fl 2.0 mm; in fr to 3.8 mm.
- corolla width 2.0 mm
- nutlets 4, homomorphic, honkingly tubercled, 2.0 mm, triangular-ovate, 0.2 mm shorter than style.
When I first opened the calyx, the green nutlets had a rounded edge.  But after an hour, they developed the sharp edge seen in the photos.
Only one nutlet has a fairly clear median ridge.

"Glebionis coronaria","2019-03-27 13:07:16 -0700","This specimen was found on the Tecolote hiking trails. Each flower had numerous petals and on the tips were white in color and then become yellow when looking towards the center. The flowers were not too big in size and were smaller than the palm of my hand. The buds were hard to the touch. The soil they were growing in was slightly dry but for the most part was not too hard. The leaves grew in clusters and were much smaller than the flowers themselves. The entirety of the plant was tall in size but did not grow wide and bushy. It seemed as though each plant grew a fixed distance from the next instead of in one grove-like fashion. The plant was growing in direct sunlight and the outside temperature was around 73 degrees Fahrenheit.

"Carpobrotus","2019-03-27 13:08:35 -0700","This specimen was found on the Tecolote hiking trails. The plant was not tall in height, being only about 4-6 inches, although it was spread across a wide distance. In some parts the plant grew in direct sunlight and in others it grew in the shade of a nearby tree. The flowers themselves were bright yellow with numerous petals and numerous, small exposed stamen. The leaves were smooth in texture and at the very tip often had a slight red coloration. Although the tips looked slightly pointy, after touching them they did not feel this way. The leaves were not flat and instead were thick and typically had 3 sides to them. The leaves grew at an upward slant from the stem instead of growing perpendicular as many plants do.

The plant grew very wide but was no more than 3 inches in height at any given point.

"Plumbago","2019-03-27 13:13:15 -0700","This specimen was found on the Tecolote hiking trails. This plant was both tall and bushy, reaching about 5 feet, maybe 6 feet, in height. The flowers each have 5 petals and among the petals we see a light blue line running down the middle. The flowers seemed to grow in clusters stemming directly from one larger stem. The petals were soft to the touch and felt fragile. The leaves were more sturdy and on the edge of some had a reddish tone. This reddish tone was also found along some of the stems. This plant was growing in a place where it was directly exposed to sunlight and on the edge of the trail.","Tecolote Community Park, San Diego, CA, US",32.7758866667,-117.1982116667,"","plumbagos","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/21691438","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/33587831/medium.jpg","ashleighrae",21691438,"","Plantae",72308,0,0,"Wed Mar 27 2019 13:13:15 GMT-0700 (PDT)","2019-03-27","2019-03-27 20:13:15 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",10,10,"","","false","","",1460065,"2019-03-28 05:29:04 UTC","2019-03-28 05:29:31 UTC","casual","CC-BY-NC",NA,3,"true"

When looking at the flower we can see it is white with traces of a lilac color and the veins within the petals are visible. Most of the flowers had 2-3 petals and exposed pollen. The buds seem to be covered in small spikes. The plant was smooth to the touch and the leaves were rather dry. The leaves were larger, most being about the size of my palm, while the flowers were only about as big as my finger tip. The entirety of the plant was rather large and growing in abundance.

"Crotalus oreganus helleri","2019-03-27 13:45:07 -0700","This specimen was found on the Tecolote hiking trails. If I had to guess, I would say it was about 2-3 feet long. When I came across this snake I was walking along the trail and noticed about 15 feet away it had started to cross the trail. It must not have noticed me much because it did not let off any warning signs and continued to cross rather slowly. It was a darker brownish gray in color and it’s rattler was a lighter tannish white. As can be seen in the picture it does have slight variation in color among its body. After comparing it to images I researched, I believe it may be a western rattlesnake but it was difficult to tell as I did not get close enough and had to zoom in on the pictures.
