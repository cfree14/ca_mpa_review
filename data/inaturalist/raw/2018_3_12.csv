"Setophaga townsendi","2018-03-12 00:00:00 -0600","We found some nice birds and lovely landscapes while hiking through the butterfly garden along the nature trails at the Tijuana Slough NWR in San Diego the other day.
Just when things seemed to be slowing down in the heat of the day, I stopped for a quick break in the shade underneath a nice big pine tree, and boy I’m glad I did! It looks like the wildlife took to the shade as well, and much to my surprise I found myself staring face-to-face with one of the most beautiful little birds I had NEVER seen before - A blazing, bright male Townsend’s Warbler popped out of the tree less than three feet from my face!!!
He gave me a rather inquisitive look as I covered my mouth and shrieked in sheer delight! We spent some quality time together and I even got a few nice shots before he carried on with his northward migration. What a beautiful bird...
