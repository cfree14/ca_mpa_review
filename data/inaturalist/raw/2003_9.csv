"Helminthoglypta","2003-09-06 00:00:00 -0800","Barry Roth shared with me that this species is yet described. It is found in association with Noyo interesessa. The species has a very solid shell and  shares traits of H. stiversiana and H. arrosa. Barry was leaning towards an affiliation with H. arrosa pomoensis. It really does resemble pomoensis but not on the larger scale as that sub-species.
