Coyotes have been happening here recently. This is one of four that emerged from the vegetation with the coyote brush in the background. One coyote had a gopher and another had its eye on a nearby hunting Great Egret. The egret sensing the unwanted attention escaped the area. My first evidence of the actual presence of the coyotes were from seeing scat and hearing their calls each time a siren had passed.

I first id&#8217;ed these a few years ago, and I believe they were just ignored before, because since then I&#8217;ve seen at least one each year.  This year there were about a dozen brought in, and most of them much larger than what had been seen in the past.  Also this year a number of these stained blue in the pores and in the flesh when cut.  This blue reaction was light, and slow compared to other blue staining species.  I hadn&#8217;t seen this blue staining in these in the past, usually they don&#8217;t stain blue.  The blue staining was noted in the Thiers&#8217; monograph, but this was the first time I saw this actually happening.</p>

This is one of a group which are known popularly (in some parts of the world) as ""butcher birds.""  That's because they are predators -- eating insects, small reptiles, and even other birds.  Apparently that small hook on the bill can cause some damage.

When they have captured an insect or small lizard (and killed it), they often impale their prey on a thorn.  In fact some observers have noticed that if there are no trees or bushes with thorns about -- you won't find shrikes, either.

While none of these symptoms are definitive (though the weeping is a very good/bad sign), together they're highly suggestive.
