<p><b>Habitat:</b>  mixed redwood and tanoak forest</p>
<p><b>Substrate:</b>  unknown (collector unknown), though almost certainly saprotrophic.  given material observed at base, either growing terrestrially in woody debris or directly on wood.</p>
<p><b>Taste:</b> astringent, tart, pores seemingly milder.</p>
<p><b>Odor:</b> conky, like sweet rubber bands</p>
<p><b>Pileus:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Shape: bracket- or fan-like, singular or comprised of multiple shelves up to 16cm in diameter, depressed at stipe apex (if present) or point of attachment, broadly to acutely fluted, radially undulating, occasionally splitting and recombining to form rounded holes or gaps, radially streaked (more apparent at margin).  Margin straight.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Color: Off-white to pale yellow, some areas discoloring yellow/brown with age or bruising, dingier toward the disc which is dirtied by collecting fallen debris.  Adorned with small (up to 1mm), circular to radially-elongated, semi-translucent dimples on all portions of the cap surface (though more concentrated toward the margin), resembling indentations left from exudative droplets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Texture:  Generally glabrous though unevenly and coarsely roughened by small granular pieces of included debris, which are more concentrated toward the disc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Context:  Rubbery but fragile, fibrous, breaking cleanly.  Varying in thickness (~3mm-7mm). White and unchanging.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Stipe:</b> Absent or, if present, then rudimentary, comprised of a short (~4cm), tough, fibrous, laterally-attached, bone-like portion of sterile tissue which gradually fans out into the pileus.  Flesh distinctly firmer than throughout the rest of the fruiting body.</p>
<p><b>Hymenophore:</b> Minutely poroid (5-6 per mm), annual, comprising a single layer of tubes of up to 5mm in length.  Pores circular to rounded, frequently vertically elongated, mouths white though some areas latently discoloring dingy yellow or greyish-brown with age/bruising.  Remaining tube length noticeably darker (pale grayish-green), dissepiments thin and finely lacerate.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hyphal System:</b> Dimitic skeletal.  Both generative and skeletal hyphae thick-walled, skeletals considerably wider (up to 12μm), unbranching, with abundant single, double or multiple<sup class=""footnote"" id=""fnr1""><a href=""#fn1"">1</a></sup> clamps at base, generative hyphae more slender (2-5μm) and slightly contorted, occasionally branching, with single clamps.</p>
<p><b>Spores:</b> 1-guttulate, smooth, inamyloid<sup class=""footnote"" id=""fnr2""><a href=""#fn2"">2</a></sup>, oblong- to broadly-ellipsoid to subglobose, inequilateral in side view.</p>

The DNA barcode

Although currently undescribed (UCSC-F-0079 proposed as the type specimens), this taxon has been known to local mycologists for at least 40 years, but went under the application of the European name A. baccata. In combination with the very distinctive habitat, the elongate/low Q value spores (unusual for an Amanita, see sporograph images), this taxon is distinctive and recognizable, among the few Lepidella in California.

However, although strongly expected that this species is a distinct taxon, publication will require resolution of the use of the name A. baccata in North America. That name has been used indiscriminately to refer to any Lepidella growing in sand. Publication will require inspection of various other collections, including a number of 1935 collections made by Burlingham in Pacific Grove (under Monterey Pine in sandy soil, all made within the span of a few weeks); as well as a number of Idaho and Michigan collections.

Only known from Santa Cruz County, California, USA. Occurrence limited to a few areas within Zayante-series soil substrates, which are derived from the degradation of Santa Margarita sandstone (uplifted marine sediments). These sandhill habitats are extremely limited in geographic area, naturally highly fragmented, and are entirely confined to Santa Cruz County. This habitat is home to a number of endemic plants and animals, some of which are federally listed as Endangered species. Entire area of occupancy likely < 240 acres.

Ectomycorrhizal; obligate mutualist with either Quercus agrifolia and/or Pinus ponderosa (research needed), but only where these trees are found only on Zayante-series sand soils in Santa Cruz County; especially the small fraction of the sandhills classified as “Sand Parkland”. These soils drain very quickly, and fruiting thus occurs in limited windows of one to two weeks, usually in winter, with records from November through early March depending on rainfall patterns. Peak fruiting often in December. Usually as scattered single fruitbodies, but sometimes in groups of up 8 or so in a small area.

It is speculated that the birds put the acorns in the granaries for a number of different benefits. They are stored for a time when food is scarce, keeps it away from other animals that are interested in them for food and possible the meat of the acorn breaks down which makes it easier to eat. Also, insects can get into the acorn and then the birds get to eat them too. Many of the acorns have holes ( as in the third picture)  where, I guess, insects have gotten inside, so I think that this idea is maybe a good one.","Pepperwood Preserve, CA",38.5861005441,-122.7023398876,"","Acorn Woodpecker","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/38616","https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.inaturalist.org/photos/64299/medium.JPG","curiousgeorge61",38616,"Acorn Woodpecker","Aves",18209,2,0,"2011-11-07","2011-11-07","","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","open","false",NA,NA,714,"2011-11-09 04:27:27 UTC","2017-07-03 15:15:29 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
