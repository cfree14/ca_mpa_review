I've photographed a very similar snail in this location in the past and it was identified as a Garden Snail.  I found more today, all of them except for one on the non-native plant in one of the photos.  The shell is very thin, much different from what I think of with Garden Snail.  Looking forward to any and all comments about this snail.","Imperial Beach - Sports Park",32.575,-117.1238883333,"Garden Snail (Cornu aspersum)","Garden Snail","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/5656751","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/7003571/medium.jpg","finatic",5656751,"Garden Snail","Mollusca",480298,4,0,"2017/04/11 9:56 AM PDT","2017-04-11","2017-04-11 16:56:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",NA,NA,"","","false","","",10285,"2017-04-12 04:22:11 UTC","2021-12-26 07:53:30 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
