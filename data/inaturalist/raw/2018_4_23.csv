This is the third bald eagle sighting that I have witnessed at this lake. Two of the sightings were of adult/s and this is the third. The first sighting of and adult was towards the east side of the lake and it was tagged. The second sighting was an adult flying over the Otay lakes county park which may have been the same tagged bald eagle but I could not tell. I was able to take a quick picture (blurry) of my first bald eagle sighting at Otay lakes, missed my opportunity for the second sighting, and this third sighting was a complete success. The immature eagle was just finishing up eating a fish and remained at this tree for at least another 45 min. I returned to look for the eagle 3 hours later and to my surprise I found him/her in the exact spot it was earlier which seemed to me like it had not moved during that time but who knows. There are a few bald eagle sightings reported on iNaturalist in the surrounding area and even as for down as Mexico which leads me to believe they're all of the same birds but that's just my guess.
