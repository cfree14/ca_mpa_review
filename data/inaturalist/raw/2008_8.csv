I originally thought Uinita but the populations in California are so limited and scattered that I hesitated to give that ID. However, I looked at pictures of and sightings on inaturalist. 
I believe my original thought was correct. It is a very brown chipmunk with some orange on the side. Bi color ears with a white spot behind the ear. The lower dark stripe is indistinct. Facial stripes are prominent and dark, cheeks white. 
The kicker for me is the tail. It has a very grizzled appearance.I found several examples on inaturalist of this species with very similar looking tails. This is not something I have personally seen in other Chipmunks where I live.
