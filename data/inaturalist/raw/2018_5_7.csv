"Sceloporus occidentalis","2018-05-07 14:41:08 -0700","This was definitely a different lizard then I’m use to seeing around Mt Diablo. The ones I usually see I’ve always called Blue Belly but they could be Fence Lizards. This one was much calmer and not as jumpy as the ones I usually see. It looked so interesting because I believe it is in the middle of shedding its skin which is why the head is a different color from the body. Maybe that is also why it seemed so calm and mellow.
