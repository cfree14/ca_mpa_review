Thousands have been planted to hold back the wind and spray and to hide the desolate wetlands as we drive to San Francisco Airport on Bayshore Freeway. Hundreds have been planted along the Shoreline Trail in Mountain View as it curves around Shoreline Golf Links. There are thousands more through Berkeley and beyond and on Highway 101 around Santa Barbara. opercula large enough for kids to fit on their fingertips like thimbles and play “witches’ fingers.”

"Melanerpes formicivorus","2018-06-24 17:24:00 -0700","After two adult Acorn Woodpeckers protected the juvenile from an inquisitive Red-tailed Hawk (https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/13773761), a female checked in with the little one in the nest hole. A male arrived with an acorn, and cracked it open a few yards above the hole. The juvenile climbed up to him, eager to be fed. But then, like every kid, the little one really didn't want to go back into its safe nest. It flapped its wings, looked around, maybe wanted more food. The male waited at the hole, called and briefly stuck his head into the nest, as if he were saying, ""In you go, now!"" He repeated this over and over again, and after a while went into the hole himself and called from there. A second male adult arrived, and waited at the nest hole while the first male climbed up and coaxed the juvenile back down. The waiting adult then went into the hole first, the little one followed. I'm so impressed by the group response to a ""situation,""  not once but twice, involving several adults of both genders communicating, cooperating, problem solving.

I once again stayed low under a tree and waited. After about ten minutes, a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk arrived on top of the pole and stared at the little woodpecker. It took under a minute for two adult Acorn Woodpeckers to show up and fly circles above the power pole, sounding alarm calls. The juvenile disappeared into its nest hole, and the hawk flew away. Two adult woodpeckers then arrived at the nest hole to feed the little one, my next observation, https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/13782249. But that's why Acorn Woodpeckers probably like these bare, exposed power poles: They can keep an eye on any predators from far away.

I’m irritated with myself for not getting a clearer photo of the green tag.  I’m pretty sure the number on it was 36.  I didn’t look at the tag very closely.  If I encounter a tagged bird in the future I will be more attentive to that.

On 6/26/18:
I went back and found the bird again.  It was in the same spot.  Noticeably more dehydrated; shrunken; feet dried out and smaller than they looked on 6/24. 

Light green plastic tag only has “36” and a circle on it.  No other visible markings.  I took some more photos and some measurements:

wingspan 18.5-19”
wing feathers 7.5-9” long (top to bottom)

This is the part of my iNaturalist experience where I get to learn a ton about bird tagging and try to find out where this may have been tagged, and why.  (A mystery I think will be fun to attempt solving!)  Maybe a reason to start my first iNat journal?  :)","10 Ebony Ave, Imperial Beach, CA, US",32.5775033333,-117.1327888333,"","Feral Pigeon","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/13764916","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/20294015/medium.jpg","davidajoy",13764916,"Feral Pigeon","Aves",122767,2,0,"Sun Jun 24 2018 19:47:35 GMT-0700 (PDT)","2018-06-24","2018-06-25 02:47:35 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",5,5,"","open","false","","",785735,"2018-06-25 06:38:32 UTC","2021-08-10 16:10:10 UTC","research","",NA,3,"false"
