The whorls of the shell are smoothe and undecorated, with a tightly set suture separating one whorl from the next.  The orange-brown color of this shell is fairly typical of the species.

From the apertural view, one can observe how thick the walls of this shell are.  Also observe how the shell's columella terminates in a single knobby tooth along the inner surface of the aperture; this tooth is apparently diagnostic, though T. brunnea differs so much from the other Tegula species in California that I've never needed to rely on it as a field mark.","Mavericks Beach, El Granada, CA",37.4954138147,-122.4970328808,"Brown Tegula, El Granada, Mavericks Beach, Pillar Point Headland, San Mateo County, Tegula brunnea","Brown Tegula","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/31528334","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/49352350/medium.jpg","arnel",31528334,"Brown Tegula","Mollusca",490478,1,0,"2017/04/27 9:15 PM PDT","2017-04-27","2017-04-28 04:15:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",8,8,"","","false","","",29323,"2019-08-26 03:52:24 UTC","2019-08-26 09:34:57 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

"Cumanotus","2017-04-27 10:57:00 -0700","The so-far undescribed species. 

From Jeff Goddard: 

""Cumanotus sp. 
Following Behrens (1991), Goddard (2004) referred to this species, which feeds on Ectopleura crocea (Agassiz, 1862) in bays and harbors, as Cumanotus fernaldi Thompson & Brown, 1984. However, as pointed out by S. Millen personal communication to JG, 8 Jan 2012), Thompson and Brown (1984) in their brief description of C. fernaldi were referring to the larger, soft-sediment dwelling species studied by Hurst (1967) that is ecologically and morphologically similar to the north Atlantic C. beaumonti (Eliot, 1906). Hurst (1967) used the name C. beaumonti for her specimens from Washington and reported that they laid corkscrew shaped egg masses with 4–14 eggs per egg capsule. Cumanotus sp. consistently has one egg per capsule (Goddard 1992; present study, Table 2), is ecologically and morphologically similar to the north Atlantic C. cuenoti Pruvot-Fol, 1948, and is undescribed (S. Millen, personal communication to JG, 8 Jan 2012). It is pictured as C. fernaldi in Behrens and Hermosillo (2005, species number 244), but that name actually applies to species number 245 in Behrens and Hermosillo (2005) (S. Millen, personal communication to JG, 8 Jan 2012). 
Unaware that two species of Cumanotus exist in the northeast Pacific Ocean, Goddard (2004, Table 1) lumped development data for both species. The complete and correct breakdown is as follows. Based on Hurst (1967), C. fernaldi (as C. beaumonti) deposits corkscrew-shaped egg masses with 4–14 eggs per capsule that hatch after 10 days at 8–11 C with type 1 shells averaging 119 mm long. Based on Goddard (1992, 2011b) and the present study, Cumanotus sp. also deposits corkscrew-shaped egg masses, but with one egg (averaging 73 mm in diameter) per capsule, hatching after 9–10 days at 12–16 C with type 1 shells averaging 130 mm long.""","California, US",36.6927974775,-121.8376271172,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/5990388","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/7490258/medium.jpg","anudibranchmom",5990388,"Cumanotus","Mollusca",50464,1,0,"2017/04/27 10:57 AM PDT","2017-04-27","2017-04-27 17:57:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",786,28505,"obscured","","true","","",26610,"2017-04-28 01:44:15 UTC","2021-02-12 02:52:09 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
