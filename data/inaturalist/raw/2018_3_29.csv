This was a very cool find. I saw something move out of the corner of my eye and saw this guy come from under a small rock ledge. Initially, I just saw the stripes and though it was a small snake but then he came out and I knew it was some type of skink. I had to research it when I got back and this is a juvenile western red-tailed skink. He is missing the end of his tail. Like most lizards and skinks, they can release part of their tail when threatened or to distract potential predators. When fully grown, these guys are a dull brownish color with reddish-orange underparts. This guy was about 3 inches long.","San Luis Obispo County, CA, USA, Location is approximate",35.2742135012,-119.9110937119,"","Gilbert's Skink","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/12844642","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/18637100/medium.jpg","naturephotosuze",12844642,"Gilbert's Skink","Reptilia",73789,4,0,"2018/03/29 3:29 PM PDT","2018-03-29","2018-03-29 22:29:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",122,122,"","open","false","","",497764,"2018-05-27 00:52:50 UTC","2021-10-29 17:00:38 UTC","research","",NA,NA,"false"

"Medicago polymorpha","2018-03-29 17:48:00 -0700","California Burclover (Medicago polymorpha), also known as Toothed Burclover and Toothed Medick.  Photographed along El Camino Real, near the southern terminus of Acalanes Drive in Sunnyvale, CA.  Identified as California Burclover based on the following characteristics (per Jepson's eFlora):

1) From this plant's bilaterally symmetrical, pea-like flowers and compound leaves, one can quickly placed it in the Legume Family (Fabacaeae), a large complex of species that includes peas, lupines, and clovers. 
2) Now note that the upper petal (banner) appeared outside of the lower petals in bud. (See the cluster of unopened flowers to the right of the cluster of open ones.)
3) Leaf 1-pinnate, palmate, or simple. [In this case, the leaf is actually 1-pinnate. This gets me to the Papilionideae group within the Fabaceae family.]
4) Plant is an annual (not a shrub or a tree).
5) Each leaf consists of 3 leaflets, with the main leaf axis terminating in a leaflet. At first, the three leaflets makes it seem as if the leaf is palmately compound.  However, when you study the main axis of the leaf, it becomes apparent that the leaf is actually pinnately compound.
6) Lower petals are not spirally coiled.
7) Leaflet margin is toothed and wavy. 
8) Corolla yellow, ~4mm long.  This gets me to two genera - Melilotus and Medicago.  Jepson's distinguishes between these two genera based on characteristics of their seeds, which were not available at the time that this photograph was taken (late March).  However, plants belonging to the genus Melilotus have inflorescences that are many-flowered racemes, while the inflorescence in the photograph is a fairly compact, few-flowered raceme.  This inflorescence is consistent with the genus Medicago, nine species of which can be found in the state of California (all non-native).
9) The 4 mm long corolla eliminates Medicago lupulin from consideration.
10) The plant being a low-growing annual with a decumbent habit eliminates Medicago sativa from consideration.
11) From here, the remaining California species of the genus Medicago are differentiated based on wheter or not their seeds are prickly.  Of the three species whose seeds are not prickly. only one can be foune in the San Francisco Bay Area, M. orbicularis.  For that species, the stipules are dissected to the base, creating a cluster of bristles around the leaf axils.  The stipules of the species in the photograph are deeply toothed, but not dissected in that way, so it cannot be M. orbicularis.  By implication, this also means that the fruit of the species in the photograph are prickly.
12) The toothed stipules and glabrous nature of the herbage in the photograph eliminates two more species from the running (M. minima and M. rigidula).
13) The leaflets lacking a dark central spot eliminates M. arabica and M. truncatula from consideration.
14) Leaflets varying between 10 mm and 20 mm in length; corolla ~4 mm in length; and plant widespread and common. This final combination of characteristics identify the species in the photograph as the California Burclover (Medicago polymorpha), not the Mediterranean Medick (M. praecox), which was the last remaining contender.","Sunnyvale, CA - along El Camino Real, near southern terminus of Acalanes Drive",37.3759885907,-122.0597523451,"Califonia Burclover, Medicago polymorpha, Santa Clara County, Sunnyvale, Toothed Burclover, Toothed Medick","bur clover","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/10858566","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/15234606/medium.jpg","arnel",10858566,"Bur Clover","Plantae",53151,1,0,"2018/03/29 5:48 PM PDT","2018-03-29","2018-03-30 00:48:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",2,2,"","","false","","",29323,"2018-04-13 16:00:45 UTC","2018-04-22 02:55:17 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
