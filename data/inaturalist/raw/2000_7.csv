"Pinus longaeva","2000-07-29 14:00:00 -0700","ancient bristlecone pine, <i>Pinus longaeva</i>, California, Mono County, White Mountains, Patriarch Grove, Fishlake Valley watershed, elevation 3469 m (11380 ft). Substrate is carbonate (dolomite).

This species is found only at high elevations of dry, isolated, sky-island mountain ranges in the Great Basin of western North America.

Currently the oldest living individuals are known from the White Mountains of eastern California, where they have been measured at nearly 5,000 years.

Over this much time, roots become exposed by slow natural erosion, even in this relatively dry cold desert environment, and many branches die. The same severe conditions force very slow growth rates that result in dense, resinous, disease-resistant and highly durable wood.

Even after death, standing and fallen wood lasts for thousands of years more, and has helped to reconstruct an unbroken tree ring record of climatic variation going back over 9,000 years.  This is long enough that the wood of ancient bristlecone pines has been used to help calibrate the Carbon-14 dating process.
