After fishing local ponds and creeks, came across this critter on side of rural road; probably victim of automobile encounter.  I had No Idea what it was ! ! !  Took home and after placing inside TWO ziplock plastic bags, placed into freezer (over my wife's bacteriological objections).  Looked on internet, and eventually found name of rodent specialist at Univ. of California in Berkeley, CA.  After emailing back and forth, including photos, I placed frozen critter into my bait cooler, and I drove down to University.  Donated critter to Univ. of Calif Vertebrate Zoology collection.  After about a week, the UC staff informed me of their identification.  Received nice T-shirt (see second photo) from Zoology Dept.  No residences immediately close to location at that time in 2004, so ""source"" of Feral CAVY remains unknown.
