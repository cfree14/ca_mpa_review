"Ligustrum","2018-06-08 16:51:35 -0700","Trying to figure out what this plant is because every time I walk past these bushes (and others like them that other neighbors also have planted), my sinuses get congested super quick, I usually end up sneezing and the smell of it’s flowers makes me super nauseous. I don’t want to end up accidentally planting one of these in the yard or something if it bothers me so much to be near it.
