Over the years we’ve had one young bison actually die from a snake bite and one horse almost die. Even my Border collie was bitten by a SPR but survived.  
But still these poor snakes have far more to fear from people then we do from them.
I try to take them far enough away as I can get them yet trying not to be too far from their original location. I hope to give them a second chance to survive and not run into people.
