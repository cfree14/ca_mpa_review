"Anser anser domesticus","2003-02-27 00:00:00 -0500","ID question: Because of the enormous size differential, I originally assumed that the little guys were true GWFs, &amp; the big ones were greylag-derived domestic stock.  But if I'm reading my Natl Geo Field Guide correctly, any white on the &quot;front&quot; makes it a GWF, which would make the little ones the tundra subspecies (Anser albifrons albifrons??) and the big ones the taiga ssp (Anser albifrons elgasi).  HOWEVER, they really don't exhibit any of the expected plumage darkness/barring differences.  That size difference seems utterly excessive too, but I took a ruler to the photo and to the drawings in the field guide, and a very rough (uncorrected for perspective) back-of-the-envelope session suggested that the little guys are almost 90% of the body mass expected for tundra birds relative to taiga.  Comments?

I don't have a &quot;real camera&quot; with a lens appropriate for catching wildlife (this was taken with my Olympus prosumer, which only has a 3X optical zoom; this was before I started digiscoping thru binocs -- not that that works any too reliably), so I'm pretty pleased at getting any shot of a hummer -- especially one taken in the wild instead of at a feeder.
