Carson Valley monkeyflower was recognized as a distinct species by Naomi Fraga in 2012, after having been confused with Erythranthe (=Mimulus) montioides and E. rubellus since its discovery in the mid 1800s.  It is a rare plant species, known only from Washoe Valley, Eagle Valley, and Carson Valley of Carson City, Douglas County, and southern Washoe County Nevada, and small portions of adjacent Alpine County, California, and Lyon County, Nevada.  It has been found nowhere else in the western United States despite extensive searches.

The species grows mainly in sagebrush-bitterbrush vegetation on sandy soils of the valley bottoms and adjacent lower slopes, and has been significantly impacted by urban and residential development.  Favorable conditions in spring of 2016 and 2017 allowed for extensive surveys and discovery of large new populations.  Some of the new populations are on public lands well removed from immediate development, but the majority are still within or adjacent to ongoing urban and residential expansion.

Also visible in this image are rosy pussypaws (Calyptridium roseum).

When mousetails are growing in open desert, you know it has been a wet year.  Usually these relatives of buttercups are found in moister habitats.  In North America this species is found at middle to subalpine elevations from southwestern Canada southward through most of the western United States.  As the scientific name suggests, the petals are small, inconspicuous, fall off early, and usually seem to be missing.

The other variety of the species, var. apetalus, is found in similar habitats in Chile and Argentina.  There are a bunch of species with similar &quot;amphitropical&quot; distributions in North and South America, and most of them are annuals of moist to wet habitats with small light seeds.  Most likely their ancestors were transported occasionally between the two areas in the past by migrating waterfowl.
