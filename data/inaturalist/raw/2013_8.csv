"Bromus tectorum","2013-08-11 10:39:37 -0600","Post-fire sagebrush steppe vegetation in the region of northeastern Nevada includes much more than Bromus tectorum. Erodium cicutarium and Sisymbrium altissimum are often more abundant, and native species of Argemone, Asclepias, Elymus, Lygodesmia, Poa, and Tetradymia, for example, are common. Such sites are perhaps degraded such that cheatgrass can't compete but then this argues against a cheatgrass-fire cycle. This site wasn't all that degraded because it was covered with sagebrush steppe until this fire that occurred a few years before this photo was taken.

"Aporus luxus","2013-08-11 11:40:00 -0700","Three of these blue-black wasps were on a single California Buckwheat (<i>Eriogonum fasciculatum</i> var. <i>foliolosum</i>) shrub in sage scrub at the Claremont Colleges' <a href=""http://bfs.claremont.edu"">Bernard Field Station</a>. The wasps were moving about quickly and were quite twitchy, so they were rather hard to photograph. Also, because they moved about so much, I couldn't keep straight which individual was which, so these photos may be of the same or different individuals.

These photos were originally posted to BugGuide (https://bugguide.net/node/view/834084), where Nick Fensler identified the wasp as <i>Aporus</i> sp., and iNat's computer vision agrees.

The size of the images was reduced for posting on BugGuide. If larger images are required for identification or other purposes, please let me know. I also have some additional photos, so please let me know if specific features not shown here are required for identification, and I'll see if they show in any other photos.

"Elgaria multicarinata","2013-08-15 00:00:00 -0800","I observed this lizard, photos attached, in my very small backyard in Irvine, a 2005 development. It was a nice warm day in August 2013. I have only succulent plants in my small yard with most in pots, that have been growing over 5 years. Other side of my block wall is community landscaping. There has been a lot of dirt moving, for housing developments across the Jeffery street. They are also building an extension of nature trail along the drainage from the hills. So I suspect lizard came from that area. Lizard let me take a few snaps and stayed in same place for awhile then it disappeared. I have not seen it since. --Joanne

Lo and behold, this beautiful rattler was five feet behind me at the creekside!  It was very relaxed, just stretched out and waiting for me to leave.  As I got closer to take pictures, it did nothing but flick its tongue in and out every time I moved.  Totally chill, and a shared moment.  One of my favorite snake encounters.

I thought it'd spin a cocoon, but instead it just sat unmoving on the underside of a bean for a couple of days before starting to turn grey yesterday.  Apparently its cocoon is just its own skin.  Much darker today.  Still fuzzy around the edges, like the caterpillar.  Has a few small silk threads holding it in place.

[Hatched out into a lovely Gray Hairstreak in late August, and was released back into the yard.]
