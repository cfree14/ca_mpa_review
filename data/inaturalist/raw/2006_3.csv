"Canis latrans","2006-03-11 16:00:06 -0800","I was sitting on a bench next to a trail enjoying the view when I noticed a coyote on the slope below me who was making his way uphill, eyeing me while he circled around. When he finally reached my level he trotted away down the trail until he disappeared around the bend. A second later a big dumb dog came loping along in the opposite direction  acting oblivious to the coyote that he had just missed. A minute or so later his people finally showed up. 

I wish I could have seen that. They were in the same spot nearly at the same time.  How did the coyote hide from the dog?  The dog didn't act like he had just seen or smelled anything unusual.  I guess the dog was super good-natured and didn't care.","windy hill open space preserve",37.36849,-122.224961,"","Coyote","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/80030225","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/131129563/medium.jpg","dawnendico",80030225,"Coyote","Mammalia",42051,3,0,"Sat Mar 11 2006 16:00:06 GMT-0800 (PST)","2006-03-11","2006-03-12 00:00:06 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",227,227,"","open","false","","",29312,"2021-05-23 22:58:03 UTC","2021-05-24 14:30:20 UTC","research","CC-BY",NA,3,"false"

"Matheteus theveneti","2006-03-16 00:00:00 -0800","A red beetle with comb like antennae. According to the R. T. Peterson guide this insect is in one of the beetle families due to more than 5 segments on the antennae. 

The size of my thumb is 15/16 of and inch. When I zoomed out of the image on my computer to fit my thumb, this gave a measurement of 7/16 of and inch to the insect. 

The location of where i saw this insect is not exact but approximate to where I remembered being and within a 2 mile radius. 

The tree the insect was seen on is a California Wild Lilac tree (Ceanothus thyrsiflorus).

I am continuing to investigate the species name but hopefully someone who is an expert and can utilize the information given to give me a solid scientific name for this animal. 

Email me for additional questions.
