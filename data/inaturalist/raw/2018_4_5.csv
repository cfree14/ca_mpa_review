The color (orange, with green smudges), shape, size etc. Give me strong confidence in the i.d.

Misnomer usage because of info obtained from lectures at Colorado Micological Society.
Like many mushrooms in the Americas, this one is named due to a close resemblance to a European species. The European species reportedly is good to eat (hence the name deliciosa).
My limited experence with these in Colorado found them without taste and of mealy texture.
