"Russula paxilloides","2007-03-25 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Ok, I need a caveat on all the Russula ids from up there.  But after saying that&#8230;</p>
<p>I am getting more certain about these as R. paxilloides.  The color of these is a nice deep bright rose red, which matches the discription in Theirs, and something like R. simillima doesn&#8217;t list such a color (although it does have pinkish red with salmon tones what ever that might be).  Another detail is the taste, where these are now off the scale for acrid, quickly acrid and very strong, in the oh my god get it off my tongue it burns, it burns type of acrid.  So, that matches the description of &#8220;very acrid&#8221; for the species.  The samples from two weeks ago had a similar color, but lighter, which can fit since the color is supposed to lighten as it grows, but the taste was less acrid.  Not sure, but probably the acrid taste can be variable, and certainly depends on the amount of moisture in the mushroom.</p>
<p>These don&#8217;t show any forking of the gills, like the sample from two weeks ago.  So, not sure what is up there, part of the &#8220;rarely forking near the margin&#8221; I guess.</p>
<p>The second photo shows slight pink tones in the stipe.  I think these are from the light showing through the cap and adding some color to the shadow, and not the actual color of the stipe, which was fairly pure white.</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60648842","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/96992781/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60648842,"Russula paxilloides","Fungi",1134027,0,0,"2007-03-25","2007-03-25","","UTC",703,703,"","","false",NA,NA,734334,"2020-09-24 21:03:36 UTC","2020-09-24 21:03:40 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"

"Russula paxilloides","2007-03-11 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Ok, not sure about these, like I say with almost every Russula sighting&#8230;  These are good size, and have exactly the same taster at the R. simillima I&#8217;ve been calling the other ones, taking 10-20 secs. to build up to acrid, and then not quite as acrid as R. cremoricolor.  The caps are kinda purple-red when young, but then fade to a light lilac-pink in the older ones.  I even found some really old beat up whitish ones near by, but they were too beat up tell if they are the same maybe, or just some old R. cremoricolor.</p>
<p>I was abl;e to get a spore print this time, and the spores are white-white.  I&#8217;ve had problem with spore prints and Russulas in the past, and there was a comment on the BAMS list from Dr. Rodham E. Tulloss that Russulas, along with Amanitas, will stop making spores if there is a change in elevation.  I gather these up near maybe 2000 ft. and take them home to my house at about 50 ft., so that might be it.  It took me quite a few tries to get a spore print for R. amoenolens, but I finally got a light yellow-creamy color spore print for that one.  So, it doesn&#8217;t shut it down completely, but there is some evidence that getting a spore print with a change in elevation in Russulas in problematic.</p>
<p>Anyway, with the acrid taste, the red fading cap, and white spore print this points to R. simillima or R. paxilloides.  Looking at the features in the discription, the only clear difference your could see it seems is the hight of the warts on the spores, one has short warts, and the other tall warts&#8230;  oh, boy.  But some features which might happen are seen here, the gills fork.  I didn&#8217;t see this before, but in each of these a number of gills can be seen to fork somewhere close to the margin.  This is easy to see in the third photo, and in the younger cap if you look close.  The descriptions for the two state that R. simillima rarely forks near the stipe, and R. paxilloides rarely forks near the margin.  So, I&#8217;m going for it&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really confused by what he mean rarely forks, does this mean rarely you find a &#8217;shroom with some number of forking gills, or that for a given &#8217;shroom you will find some small number of gills forking.  Because I saw it on each one of these &#8217;shrooms that there was gills forking near the margin.</p>
<p>Other problems, he lists R. paxilloides as very acrid, and I wouldn&#8217;t say that, although they are acrid.  And that lamellulae are absent, except in all of these there some small amount of lamellulae present, so I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Anyway, until I can measure the hight of the warts on the spores, I guess that is all I can say.  (Except to say, hight of <br />
warts on spores makes for a different species?!?)</p>","Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, California, USA",37.33015,-122.18,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60648678","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/96992540/medium.jpeg","douglassmith",60648678,"Russula paxilloides","Fungi",1134027,0,0,"2007-03-11","2007-03-11","","UTC",703,703,"","","false",NA,NA,734334,"2020-09-24 21:02:05 UTC","2020-09-24 21:02:13 UTC","needs_id","",NA,NA,"false"
