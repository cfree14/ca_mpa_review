"Diploneis abscondita","2018-05-18 00:00:00 -0700","Valves are elliptic to linear-elliptic, with bluntly rounded apices. Central area of the valve face is almost flat, whereas marginal parts become arcuate as they subtly merge into the poorly differentiated mantle. Raphe filiform, straight, with slightly expanded central endings, which are moderately spaced; longer terminal fissures bent onto the same side of the valve mantle. Axial area narrow, expanding lanceolate towards the center. Central area small with variable outlines, often apically elliptical, but clearly separated in all cell-cycle stages. H-shaped appendices barely developed. Axial internal canals marked outside by transapical striae composed of three or four areolae, altogether forming a conspicuous rhombical-lanceolate area being softly arched around the central nodule. Adjacent regular striae throughout, 13-15 in 10 µm, uniseriate but becoming biseriate near the valve margins onto the mantle. The areolae are opposed, not alternating. Number of areolae in 10 µm is 13-18.","Sonoma County, US-CA, US",38.29448056,-122.6663611,"","","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/25643253","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/41745493/medium.jpg","natashaphillips",25643253,"Diploneis abscondita","Chromista",895317,0,0,"2018-05-18","2018-05-18","","Mountain Time (US & Canada)",38,38,"","","false","","",1726258,"2019-05-23 22:44:50 UTC","2019-06-12 16:41:24 UTC","needs_id","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"
