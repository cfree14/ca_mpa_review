"Sairocarpus kingii","2017-04-21 16:43:38 -0700","least snapdragon, Antirrhinum kingii, California, White Mountains, Coldwater Canyon, Chalfant Valley - Owens Valley drainage, elevation 1600 m (5250 ft).

You know it's been wet in the desert when this species shows up. This humble snapdragon is endemic to cooler parts of the northern Mojave Desert and warmer parts of the southern Great Basin of western North America below 2300 meters (7500 feet) elevation, and getting as far north as southeastern Oregon.

In this species the little branch accompanying each flower will elongate into a fully flowering branch if moisture persists late enough in the season.  In related vining species, this structure becomes a tendril that helps to support and secure the plant to the surrounding vegetation.

The last time I saw this annual species was when I found it in this same spot in the rainy spring of 1986, despite several intervening attempts.  It was reported to be abundant in the Death Valley area during the 2017 season, and I will soon post some additional White Mountains locations that turned up for the first time the same year.  Because it appears so rarely, it is probably more common than its 20 or so historical specimen records might suggest.

Nevertheless, limestone monkeyflower is a regional endemic, limited to the northern Mojave Desert and southwestern Great Basin Desert of southeast Mono and eastern Inyo counties in California, and Esmeralda, southern Nye, and western Clark counties in Nevada. As its name reflects, it seems to be found only on rocky soils and slopes with a strong carbonate component, which happen to be very common soils within its limited geographic range.  The species has been found at elevations of 915-2165 meters (3000-7100 feet).

Limestone monkeyflower was recognized as a distinct species by Naomi Fraga in 2012, after having been confused with Erythranthe (=Mimulus) montioides since its earliest collections in 1937.  Its closest relative actually appears to be Erythranthe rubella, from which it differs in having calyces broadly cylindric and straight while in flower (vs narrower and curved), largest flowers 5-9 mm across (vs 3-5 mm) with longitudinal maroon streaks (vs round or transverse spots), styles included (vs shortly exserted), and leaves with stalked glands (vs sessile glands) and broader on average.

This always takes me by surprise in the desert, especially this far north, where it is near its northern limit.  This is typically a species of fire-adapted chaparral vegetation in western California, and of interior chaparral in central Arizona and some intervening desert mountain ranges, below about 2200 meters (7200 feet) elevation.  But here in the White Mountains it is found on rocky calcareous soils and scree in sparse vegetation that rarely if ever experiences fire.  Here it just pops up in wet years, burn or (usually) no burn.  Maybe the hot shifting rock helps to mimic fire disturbance?

The species also extends shortly into southwestern Utah, southern Nevada, and Baja California.

This distinctive species of rocky habitats is centered in the Mojave Desert of the southwestern United States, and extends shortly into adjacent portions of the Great Basin and Sonoran deserts and the Colorado Plateau.  Like many other warm desert species, it approaches its northwestern and high-elevation limits here in the southern part of the White Mountains.

This subspecies is a regional endemic, being confined to Owens Valley and adjacent foothills in Mono and Inyo counties, California, below about 1700 meters (5600 feet) elevation.  It is distinguished from other subspecies by its yellow flowers and basal leaves mostly lacking any lateral lobes.  These plants were just a few miles north of the type location for the subspecies, Laws, California, a historical railroad station just north of Bishop.

The relatively pale yellow of these flowers suggest that these plants are intergrading with subspecies integrior (as subspecies often do, almost by definition) -- a more widespread white-flowered variant also found in this area.

Here is another example of what makes this Coldwater Canyon drainage floristically weird and exceptional.  It seems to provide a northwestern high-elevation outpost and refugium for a bunch of different Death Valley and Mojave Desert species.  Besides this species, these include the last two posts, Mono penstemon (Penstemon monoensis) and Coville goldpoppy (Eschscholtzia covillei).  They also include July Gold (Dedeckera eurekensis), shiny sandpaper plant (Petalonyx nitidus), limestone monkeyflower (Erythranthe calcicola, coming up soon), Cooper jewelflower (Caulanthus cooperi), bush cryptantha (Cryptantha racemosa), and hidden phacelia (Phacelia cryptantha).  All of the above are the only records for Mono County, California.

Panamint stickleaf is extreme on this list of species, not being found anywhere else in the White or Inyo Mountains that I know of.  Its nearest occurrences are much farther south and east in the mountain ranges and valleys surrounding Death Valley, southward shortly into the eastern Mojave Desert of California, and sparsely eastward across southern Nevada to the edge of northwestern Arizona.  It's favorite habitat is dry coarse calcareous rocky soils and slopes below 1400 meters (4600 feet) to below sea level in Death Valley.

This species and its distinctive subspecies are all centered in the Mojave Desert of southeastern California, southern Nevada, and western Arizona, with some extending into the adjacent southern Great Basin, eastern Sierra Nevada, and southern California Transverse Ranges.  In the White Mountains it is restricted to the lower and warmer desert slopes.

Also visible in the background are the common annuals yellowthroats (Phacelia fremontii) and whitestem stickleaf (Mentzelia albicaulis).

Also know as little blazing star, this is one of our most abundant and widespread desert annual species.  A few plants can usually be found flowering even in very dry years.  Its geographic range also extends well beyond the North American deserts to include most of the interior western U.S. below 2300 meters (7500 feet) elevation, plus adjacent southwestern Canada and northwestern Mexico.

Seeds of this species were harvested by indigenous people, and were considered a dietary staple by some bands of Paiute.

This is a common species of open rocky habitats in the deserts and mountains of the southwestern United States and adjacent northwestern Mexico. It really shows up in wet years like this, and sometimes not at all in dry years. In between, it is often restricted to more sheltered rock crevices where moisture can concentrate.

Another of the big bright desert annuals that greet a big water year, this species is confined to the east side of the central Sierra Nevada in California, eastward to adjacent parts of the southern Great Basin and northern Mojave Desert in western Nevada, at elevations of 400-2000 meters (1300-6600 feet).  It is very similar to Mentzelia jonesii from somewhat lower elevations farther south and east in the Mojave Desert, and I identified these plants based solely on geography, since the other main differences between the two are different sculpturing of the seed coats, and different chromosome numbers, neither of which were available to me!  The type location of Mentzelia nitens is just north of here near Benton, California.

Also called blazing stars, the common name stickleaf comes from the tiny barbed hairs on the foliage and other parts of most Mentzelia species, which cause them to adhere to clothing and other passing epidermal coverings, and no doubt aid in dispersal of the plants and their seeds.

Also visible in this images are yellowthroats (Phacelia fremontii).

It really shows up in wet years like this, and sometimes not at all in dry years.  In between, it is often restricted to more sheltered rock crevices where moisture can concentrate.

This is one of the monkeyflower species with both pink and yellow flower color forms.  Sometimes only one form is present in a population, but the other form is usually nearby, as another post will show soon.

The curved calyx and round to transverse reddish spots on the lower flower lobe are two characteristics that help separate yellow forms of this species from the very similar Erythranthe calcicola, which will also be coming up in future posts.

After wet winters this is one of the more abundant annuals in the Mojave and southern Great Basin deserts of southwestern North America.

There is a variant in west central California, west of the deserts, with throats purple instead of yellow, and flowers averaging a bit larger.  This seems to be a well-defined geographic variant that probably deserves a separate name.

The yellow-throated variant is often confused with sticky yellowthroats, Phacelia bicolor, but that species has more finely divided (bipinnate) leaves with longer and denser spreading hairs.

Formerly known as Camissonia pterosperma, this inconspicuous desert annual is made even harder to find by only appearing after wet winters, and otherwise persisting as seeds in the soil, disguised as grains of sand.  It is endemic to the Great Basin and closely adjacent areas of the western United States at high desert and lower montane elevations.  This is the only species in the genus Chylismiella, which is differs from related members of the Evening Primrose Family by its distinctive seeds.
