"Sonchus oleraceus","2017-04-23 00:00:00 -0800","Common Sow Thistle (Sonchus oleraceus), which I found at Picchetti Ranch Open Space Preserve.  This plant resembles the wild lettuces (genus Lactuca), to which it is closely related; however, the leaves are a giveaway that it is something else.  The very long, winged petioles on the larger leaves, the clasping nature of the younger leaves and the fairly variable leaf shape are distinctive for ths species.  None of the wild lettuces have leaves like this.

Shot one shows the plant from the vantage point of someone looking straight at it, and provides a decent look at its first blooming inflorescence - a single composite flower head.  Shot two looks at the plant from above, so one can see the variability in its leaf shape.

"Symphoricarpos mollis","2017-04-23 00:00:00 -0800","This plant's sprawling, vine-like habit indicates that it is Creeping Snowberry (Symphoricarpos mollis), rather than the other Snowberry in the area, S. albus var. laevigatus, which is a bush.  Its mostly two-flowered inflorescences are another clue that it is S. mollis, as S. ablbus var. laevigatus has inflorescences that generally have 8 or more flowers to them.

This shot is a close-up showing the leaves and flowers (which are not in bloom yet, but definitely thinking about it).  The next shot in this set shows the plant in situ, so it's easy to see its sprawling habit and its lowly stature.

"Neotamias merriami","2017-04-23 00:00:00 -0800","Picchetti Ranch Open Space Preserve is one of the better parks in our area to sea Merriam's Chipmunks going about their business.  I often see them in the trees, keeping an eye out for predators and occassionally uttering their bird-like squeaks. However, this one appeared to be feasting on something (exactly what it was feasting on never became apparent). 

It was so intent on its meal that it ignored me as I photographed it.  I was able to take several shots of it, with this one being the best of the batch.  In this shot, you can see the characteristic pattern of light and dark stripes on its face.

"Sisyrinchium bellum","2017-04-23 00:00:00 -0800","I found this photogenic grouping of Western Blue-eyed Grass along the Zinfandel Trail at Picchetti Ranch Open Space Preserve.  This is actually a perplexing wildflower species to shoot, as it opens mainly during sunny weather, but looks really harsh and flat under those conditions.  A passing cloud helped in this case; working quickly, I was able to capture the delicate, almost wispy nature of these wildflowers before the cloud rolled away, causing them to be bathed in harsh sunlight once again.

Accompanying this clump of Western Blue-eyed Grass is some Dove's-Foot Crane's Bill (Erodium molle) and the massive, spiky leaves of some Milk Thistle (Silybum marianum).

This bat was captured by Gabriel Reyes of the USGS as part of a White-nose Syndrome (WNS) surveillance study under National Park Service permit #: PINN-2017-SCI-0004. Second photo depicts collection of a sample to test for WNS. After the documentation of WNS in Washington State in 2016, a series of studies across the Western United States by the NPS and other land managers has been launched to determine which Western species may be vulnerable to WNS and identify areas areas where the disease has either already arrived or may appear. Additional work to better understand the distribution and ecology of bats in the Bay Area will be underway in the summer of 2017, including acoustical monitoring work at several sites in California.","Pinnacles National Park, Paicines, CA, US",36.495845,-121.1425555,"","Fringed Myotis","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/5975643","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/7468824/medium.jpg","danielgeorge",5975643,"Fringed Myotis","Mammalia",40347,1,0,"Sun Apr 23 2017 23:27:34 GMT-0700 (PDT)","2017-04-23","2017-04-24 06:27:34 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",30,30,"","","false","","",21318,"2017-04-27 02:08:59 UTC","2019-01-09 19:56:40 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,3,"false"
