Red stems indicate this species locally. Also if you gently push down the bottom (fused wing) petal, you can expose the keel petal, which has different degrees of hairiness on the upper and lower surfaces.

An illustration of the keel being exposed from the wing petals can be seen here:

"Plantago lanceolata","2018-06-10 11:10:00 -0700","English Plantain (Plantago lanceolata), also known as Ribwort photographed near Los Gatos Creek at Vasona Lake County Park in Los Gatos, CA.  There are two shots in the set of pictures documenting this species at Vasona Lake County Park:  a relative wide shot show several plants in situ on dry, rocky ground near Los Gatos Creek, and a closeup of several inflorescences.  

Jepson's e-Flora distingusihes the different species in the genus Plantago based, in part, on the characteristics of their seeds and the minute characteristics of the bracts and other tiny structures associated with its inflorescence.  While this approach is undoubtedly reliable across the entire state, it relies on features that I am not presently equipped to photograph very well.  Moreover, for the San Francisco Bay Area, P. lanceolata is fairly distinctive.  It's narrow, lanceolate, heavily ribbed, non-fleshy leaves are not shared by any of the other plantain species found in the San Francisco Bay Area;  Plantago major comes closest, but even there, its heavily ribbed leaves are ovate to broadly elliptical in shape, not narrowly lanceolate.  Moreover, the squared-off and grooved peduncle of P. lanceolata's is unique; no other plantain found in the San Francisco Bay Area has this trait.","Vasona Lake County Park, Los Gatos, CA",37.2392703717,-121.97004758,"English Plantain, Los Gatos, Los Gatos Creek, Plantago lanceolata, Rank 3, Santa Clara County, Vasona Lake, Vasona Lake County Park","ribwort plantain","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/13507484","https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/19842551/medium.jpg","arnel",13507484,"ribwort plantain","Plantae",53178,1,0,"2018/06/10 11:10 AM PDT","2018-06-10","2018-06-10 18:10:00 UTC","Pacific Time (US & Canada)",8,8,"","","false","","",29323,"2018-06-17 04:57:37 UTC","2018-06-18 01:20:12 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

"Ludwigia peploides montevidensis","2018-06-10 11:07:00 -0700","Floating Primrose-Willow (Ludwigia peploides ssp. montevidensis), photographed at Vasona Lake County Park.  The plants photographed here were located in Los Gatos Creek, not far from where it empties into the south end of Vasona Lake.  Note that there are six pictures in the set of photographs documenting this species at Vasona Lake County Park:
Shot 1:  Closeup of a flower.
Shot 2:  Closeup of a flower and some of the plant's leaves.
Shot 3:  Closeup of a small grouping of flowers.
Shot 4:  Closeup of a newly opened flower, along with some spent flowers that have dropped their petals.  (Note the persistent sepals.)
Shot 5:  A large mass of flowers and leaves.
Shot 6:  A wide shot, showing how much of Los Gatos Creek this plant has take over.  All of the aquatic plants shown in the creek in this picture are Floating Primrose-Willow.  Apparently, this plant somehow colonized Los Gatos Creek four years ago, during out most recent drought. (See Reference [6].)

1)  Flowers available for study, which are open and clearly bisexual in nature (i.e., containing both stamens and pistils).
2) Pistils number one per flower. [Most obvious in Shots 1 and 2.]
3) Perianth in two or more whorls.  [For the species in the photographs, there are just two whorls - one of petals, and another of sepals.]
4) Perianth parts 4 - 5 per whorl.  [For this species, there are 5 petals and 5 sepals.]
5) Petals free and falling singly. [Here, they are also attached to the flower's hypanthium.]
6) Ovary inferior.  [Hard to see this in the photographs.  I did inspect the pistil in one of the flowers by moving some of the stamens out of the way, and I verified that the ovary of the flower is actually ensconced inside the hypanthium, making it inferior.] [<--- Gets me to Jepson Group 21]
7) Stamens are twice the number of petals or fewer. [Most obvious in Shots 1, 2, and 3.]
8) Only one style is present.  [Obvious in Shots 1 and 2]
9) Ovules > 1 per chamber. [Assumed, as no seeds were available for study.  It was too early in the season fir seeds.]
10) Plant is an herb. [<---- Gets me to the Evening Primrose family, Onagraceae.]
11) Sepals persistent after flower. [Obvious in Shot 4.] [<---- Gets me to the genus, Ludwigia.]
12) Leaves alternate, clustered; #stamens = 10. [The number of stamens can best be sen in Shot 1.  Alternate leaf arrangement was verified in the field.  The leaves were so densely clustered together in the shots I took that it is actually hard to determine if they are alternate or opposite in arrangement from the pictures alone.  If you look carefully, you can see alternate leaves in Shots 4 and 5, but it is hard to determine even in these pictures.]  
13) Bracts subtending each inflorescence deltate in shape; sepals ~10mm long (measured in the field); petals ~20mm long (measured in the field).  [<--- Gets me to Ludwigia peploides]. [Observed in the field.  I did not take a picture of the bracts because I did not know at the time that they were diagnostic in identifying L. peploides.]
14) Plant, including sepals, covered with spreading hairs. [<---- Gets me to Ludwigia peploides ssp. montevidensis.] [Spreading haris are visible and obvious in all of the close-up shots.]

"Cordylanthus tenuis brunneus","2018-06-10 12:12:06 -0700","Cordylanthus tenuis ssp. capillaris

Flagged for curation 6/28/2020. There was a taxon swap back in February citing Plants of the World online, which says C. tenuis ssp. capillaris is synonymous with C. tenuis ssp. brunneus. Jepson, Calflora, CNPS, and federal and state agencies still distinguish between the two. According to the January 2020 CDFW Special Vascular Plants, Bryophytes, and Lichens List, Cordylanthus tenuis ssp. capillaris is a separate subspecies and is federally endangered and listed as state rare. Subspecies brunneus isn't listed but is being displayed as FE on iNat. C. tenuis ssp. capillaris has outer bracts that are three lobed and occurs on serpentine in only a small part of western Sonoma County, north of Occidental. C. tenuis ssp. brunneus has outer bracts that are not lobed and is more widely distributed.
